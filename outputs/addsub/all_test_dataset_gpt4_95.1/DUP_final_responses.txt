'Sally paid $12.32 for peaches after using a 3 dollar coupon, which means the original price of the peaches was $12.32 + $3 = $15.32.\n\nShe also paid $11.54 for cherries.\n\nSo, in total, Sally spent $15.32 (for peaches) + $11.54 (for cherries) = $26.86.'
"Dan spent $11.76 on a snake toy and $14.54 on a cage. Therefore, the total cost of his purchases is $11.76 + $14.54 = $26.30. The dollar bill he found on the ground does not affect the cost of his purchases, as it is money he found, not spent. So, Dan's total purchase cost is $26.30."
'Mary spent a total of $13.04 + $12.27 on clothing. This equals $25.31. Therefore, Mary spent $25.31 on clothing at the mall.'
'Dan spent $130.30 on the clarinet and $11.24 on the song book. To find out how much he spent in total, you add the cost of the clarinet and the song book together. \n\nSo, $130.30 (for the clarinet) + $11.24 (for the song book) = $141.54 \n\nTherefore, Dan spent $141.54 at the music store.'
'Tom spent $9.46 on a skateboard and $9.56 on marbles. These are both considered toys. To find the total amount he spent on toys, you add the cost of the skateboard and the marbles together.\n\n$9.46 (skateboard) + $9.56 (marbles) = $19.02\n\nSo, Tom spent $19.02 on toys. The shorts are not considered a toy, so they are not included in the total.'
'The total of the lunch bill is calculated by adding the cost of the soup and the salad. \n\nSo, $1.08 (for soup) + $4.80 (for salad) = $5.88 \n\nTherefore, the total of the lunch bill was $5.88.'
'Mike spent $118.54 on speakers and $106.33 on new tires. Even though he wanted 3 CDs for $4.58 each, he decided not to buy them. Therefore, the cost of the CDs is not included in the total amount Mike spent. \n\nTo find the total amount Mike spent, we add the cost of the speakers and the tires:\n\n$118.54 (speakers) + $106.33 (tires) = $224.87\n\nSo, Mike spent $224.87 on car parts.'
'Tom spent $13.60 on the Batman game and $5.06 on the Superman game. \n\nTo find out how much he spent in total, you add the cost of the Batman game and the Superman game together. \n\nSo, $13.60 (for Batman game) + $5.06 (for Superman game) = $18.66 \n\nTherefore, Tom spent $18.66 on video games. \n\nNote: The fact that Tom already owns 2 games is irrelevant to the calculation as the cost of these games is not given.'
'Joan spent $15 on shorts, $14.82 on a jacket, and $12.51 on a shirt. To find out how much she spent in total, we need to add these amounts together.\n\nSo, $15 (for shorts) + $14.82 (for jacket) + $12.51 (for shirt) = $42.33\n\nTherefore, Joan spent a total of $42.33 on clothing.'
'Joan spent $149.16 on the trumpet, $9.98 on the music tool, and $4.14 on the song book. To find out how much she spent in total, we need to add these amounts together.\n\nSo, $149.16 (trumpet) + $9.98 (music tool) + $4.14 (song book) = $163.28\n\nTherefore, Joan spent $163.28 at the music store.'
'Melanie spent $6.95 on the Batman game, $7.90 on the strategy game, and $7.73 on the Superman game. To find out how much she spent in total, we need to add up these amounts.\n\nSo, $6.95 (Batman game) + $7.90 (strategy game) + $7.73 (Superman game) = $22.58\n\nTherefore, Melanie spent $22.58 on video games.'
"Keith spent $6.51 on a rabbit toy, $5.79 on pet food, and $12.51 on a cage. To find the total cost of his purchases, we need to add these amounts together. \n\nSo, $6.51 (rabbit toy) + $5.79 (pet food) + $12.51 (cage) = $24.81\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Keith's purchases was $24.81."
'Keith spent $136.01 on speakers, $139.38 on a CD player, and $112.46 on new tires. \n\nTo find out the total amount he spent, we need to add up all these amounts. \n\nSo, $136.01 (speakers) + $139.38 (CD player) + $112.46 (new tires) = $387.85\n\nTherefore, Keith spent a total of $387.85.'
'Joan spent $14.88 on toy cars, $5.86 on toy trucks, and $4.88 on a skateboard. \n\nTo find out how much she spent on toys in total, we need to add up these amounts:\n\n$14.88 (toy cars) + $5.86 (toy trucks) + $4.88 (skateboard) = $25.62\n\nSo, Joan spent $25.62 on toys.'

"Tom stored 14 bales of hay in the barn. \n\nHere's how you can find the answer:\n\nThe problem tells us that there were originally 46 bales of hay in the barn. It also tells us that there are now 60 bales of hay in the barn. \n\nTo find out how many bales Tom stored in the barn, you subtract the original number of bales (46) from the current number of bales (60). \n\nSo, 60 - 46 = 14. \n\nTherefore, Tom stored 14 bales of hay in the barn."
'Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour. This is because the recipe requires 7 cups of flour in total and she has already added 2 cups. So, 7 cups (total required) - 2 cups (already added) = 5 cups (still needed).'
'Fred initially had 23 dollars and now he has 86 dollars. This means that the amount of money he made washing cars is the difference between these two amounts. \n\nTo find this, we subtract the initial amount from the final amount:\n\n86 dollars (final amount) - 23 dollars (initial amount) = 63 dollars\n\nSo, Fred made 63 dollars washing cars.'
'The workers planted 95 - 31 = <<95-31=64>>64 short trees today.'
'Sally initially had 9 red orchids in the vase. After cutting some from her garden, the total number of red orchids in the vase increased to 15. \n\nTo find out how many red orchids she cut from her garden, we subtract the initial number of red orchids in the vase from the final total. \n\nSo, 15 (total red orchids after cutting) - 9 (initial red orchids) = 6 red orchids.\n\nTherefore, Sally cut 6 red orchids from her garden.'
'Sara initially had 24 peaches and after picking peaches from the orchard, she now has 61 peaches. To find out how many peaches she picked, we need to subtract the number of peaches she initially had from the number she has now. \n\nSo, 61 (the number of peaches she has now) - 24 (the number of peaches she initially had) = 37 peaches.\n\nTherefore, Sara picked 37 peaches from the orchard.'
'Joan originally found 72 seashells. After giving some to Alyssa, she has 28 seashells left. To find out how many seashells Joan gave to Alyssa, we need to subtract the number of seashells Joan has left from the number she originally found. \n\nSo, 72 (original number of seashells) - 28 (number of seashells left) = 44 seashells.\n\nTherefore, Joan gave Alyssa 44 seashells.'
'After Benny placed 3 more pencils in the drawer, the total number of pencils in the drawer became 6 (the original number of pencils) + 3 (the number of pencils Benny added) = 9 pencils. So, there are now 9 pencils in the drawer.'
"Sara has 3 green marbles and Tom has 4 green marbles. If you add Sara's green marbles to Tom's green marbles, you get the total number of green marbles they have together. \n\nSo, 3 (Sara's green marbles) + 4 (Tom's green marbles) = 7 green marbles.\n\nTherefore, Sara and Tom have a total of 7 green marbles."
'Joan and Tom grew a total of 8 + 9 = <<8+9=17>>17 watermelons.'
'The park currently has 2 maple trees. The park workers are going to plant an additional 9 maple trees today. To find out how many maple trees the park will have when the workers are finished, you simply add the number of current maple trees to the number of maple trees being planted. \n\nSo, 2 (current maple trees) + 9 (maple trees being planted) = 11 maple trees.\n\nTherefore, the park will have 11 maple trees when the workers are finished planting.'
'Mary and Keith found a total of 2 + 5 = <<2+5=7>>7 seashells together. The information about the seashells being cracked does not affect the total number of seashells they found.'

"Dan initially had 16 kittens. \n\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\nDan gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 kittens to Jason, which means he gave away a total of 7 + 4 = 11 kittens.\n\nHe now has 5 kittens left. \n\nSo, if we add the kittens he gave away to the kittens he still has, we get 11 + 5 = 16 kittens. \n\nTherefore, Dan's cat initially had 16 kittens."
'Initially, there were 7 crayons in the drawer and 6 crayons on the desk, making a total of 7 + 6 = 13 crayons.\n\nThen, Sam placed an additional 4 crayons on the desk.
