'Roger was supposed to mow 14 lawns, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. This means he only mowed 14 - 8 = <<14-8=6>>6 lawns.\n\nSince he earns 9 dollars for each lawn he mows, he earned 6 * 9 = <<6*9=54>>54 dollars.'
'The magician started with 5 decks and had 3 left at the end of the day, which means he sold 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 decks. Since he was selling the decks for 2 dollars each, he earned 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 dollars.'
'The chef still needs to cook 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 potatoes.\n\nSince each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.'

'Dave initially bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 3 pieces. So, he had 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 pieces of chocolate candy.\n\nHe then gave 5 boxes to his little brother. Since each box contains 3 pieces, he gave away 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 pieces of chocolate candy.\n\nSo, Dave still had 36 - 15 = <<36-15=21>>21 pieces of chocolate candy.'
'John already has 5 action figures and he needs 7 in total. This means he needs to buy 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 more action figures.\n\nEach action figure costs $5. So, to buy 2 more action figures, John would need 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10. \n\nTherefore, John needs $10 to complete his action figure collection.'
'The painter has 9 rooms to paint in total and he has already painted 5 rooms. This means he has 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 rooms left to paint.\n\nSince each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter will need 4 rooms * 8 hours/room = <<4*8=32>>32 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.'

'The teacher still has 4 worksheets left to grade (9 total worksheets - 5 already graded worksheets = 4 worksheets left to grade). Since each worksheet has 4 problems on it, the teacher still has 16 problems left to grade (4 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 16 problems).'
"Will invited 9 friends, but 4 couldn't come, so there were 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 friends who came to the party.\n\nIncluding Will, there were 5 friends + 1 (Will) = <<5+1=6>>6 people at the party.\n\nIf each person should have exactly 8 cupcakes, then Will should buy 6 people * 8 cupcakes/person = <<6*8=48>>48 cupcakes."
'The magician started with 12 decks and had 7 left at the end of the day, which means he sold 12 - 7 = 5 decks.\n\nSince each deck was sold for 9 dollars, the magician earned 5 * 9 = <<5*9=45>>45 dollars.'
'The chef needs to cook 2 more potatoes and each potato takes 3 minutes to cook. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to cook the rest, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook one potato.\n\nSo, 2 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato = 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.'
'The magician started with 14 decks and had 5 left at the end of the day, which means he sold 14 - 5 = <<14-5=9>>9 decks.\n\nSince each deck was sold for 5 dollars, the magician earned 9 * 5 = <<9*5=45>>45 dollars.'

'Adam initially bought 13 boxes of chocolate candy. He gave 7 boxes to his little brother, so he was left with 13 - 7 = <<13-7=6>>6 boxes of chocolate candy.\n\nSince each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy, Adam therefore still had 6 boxes * 6 pieces/box = <<6*6=36>>36 pieces of chocolate candy.'
'The group consists of 13 people, out of which 9 are kids and 4 are adults. Since kids eat free at the restaurant, we only need to calculate the cost for the adults. \n\nEach adult meal costs $7.

'If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, that means you defeated 5 enemies (7 total enemies - 2 remaining enemies = 5 defeated enemies). \n\nSince each enemy defeated gives you 8 points, you would earn 40 points for defeating 5 enemies (5 defeated enemies * 8 points per enemy = 40 points). \n\nSo, you would earn 40 points.'
'The painter has already painted 2 rooms out of 11, so he still has 11 - 2 = <<11-2=9>>9 rooms left to paint.\n\nSince each room takes 7 hours to paint, the painter will need 9 rooms * 7 hours/room = <<9*7=63>>63 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.'

'The cafeteria initially had 96 apples. After handing out 42 apples to students for lunch, they were left with 96 - 42 = <<96-42=54>>54 apples.\n\nSince each pie requires 6 apples, the number of pies they could make is 54 ÷ 6 = <<54/6=9>>9 pies.

'Frank had 19 dollars from mowing lawns. After spending 11 dollars on new mower blades, he had 19 - 11 = <<19-11=8>>8 dollars left.\n\nSince each game costs 2 dollars, Frank could buy 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 games with the money he had left.'
'Megan had 40 homework problems and finished 26 of them. This means she still had 40 - 26 = <<40-26=14>>14 problems left to do.\n\nThese 14 problems were spread over 2 pages.

This means he had 39 - 19 = <<39-19=20>>20 pieces of clothing left to wash.\n\nHe decided to split these remaining pieces of clothing into 5 equal loads. Therefore, each of these loads would contain 20 ÷ 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 pieces of clothing.'
"The company invited 18 people to the luncheon, but 12 of them didn't show up. This means that only 18 - 12 = <<18-12=6>>6 people attended the luncheon.\n\nSince each table can hold 3 people, the company needs 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 tables for the attendees."
'After the librarian takes 10 books, Mike is left with 72 books (82 - 10 = 72). \n\nSince each shelf can hold 9 books, to find out how many shelves Mike will need, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. \n\nSo, 72 books ÷ 9 books per shelf = 8 shelves. \n\nTherefore, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away all the books.'
'The pet store started with 78 puppies and sold 30 of them. This means they had 78 - 30 = <<78-30=48>>48 puppies left.\n\nThey put these remaining puppies into cages with 8 in each cage.

"First, we need to find out how many points the rest of Emily's team scored. We do this by subtracting Emily's points from the team's total points. \n\nSo, 39 (team's total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points.\n\nSince each of the other players scored 2 points each, we divide the total points scored by the rest of the team by the points each player scored.\n\nSo, 16 (points scored by the rest of the team) ÷ 2 (points each player scored) = 8 players.\n\nHowever, this doesn't include Emily. Since Emily is part of the team, we need to add her to the total number of players.\n\nSo, 8 (other players) + 1 (Emily) = 9 players.\n\nTherefore, there were 9 players on Emily's team."
"The company invited 47 people to the luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. This means that there were 47 - 7 = 40 people at the luncheon.\n\nEach table holds 5 people.
