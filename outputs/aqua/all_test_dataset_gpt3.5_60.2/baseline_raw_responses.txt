'Let the height of the tower be $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower be $d$. We can set up a right triangle with the tower as the vertical side and the distance the car has traveled as the horizontal side. Let $x$ be the distance the car has traveled when the angle of elevation is $45^\\circ$. Then, we have the following diagram:\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,0);\nC=(1,1);\ndraw(A--C--B--cycle);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,2));\nlabel("$45^\\circ$",A,SW);\nlabel("$60^\\circ$",B,SE);\nlabel("$h$",(1.2,0.5));\nlabel("$d$",(0.5,-0.2));\nlabel("$x$",(0.5,0.5));\n[/asy]\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have $\\tan 45^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x}$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x+d}$. Simplifying these equations gives us $x=h$ and $x+d=\\sqrt{3}h$. Solving this system of equations gives us $d=\\sqrt{3}h-h=(\\sqrt{3}-1)h$.\n\nSince the car is traveling at a uniform speed, the ratio of the distance traveled to the time taken is constant. Therefore, the ratio of $d$ to the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$ is equal to the ratio of $d$ to the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. The time taken for the angle of elevation to change from $45^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$ is $10$ minutes, so we have $\\frac{d}{10}=\\frac{d}{t}$. Solving for $t$ gives us $t=10$ minutes.\n\nTherefore, the car will take $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) None of these}}$ more time to reach the base of the tower.'
'Let the original price of the item be $x.\nThe discounted price is 0.78x (since it is discounted by 22%).\nThe customer pays 0.78x - 20 dollars.\nWe are told that this amount is $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can write the equation:\n0.78x - 20 = (1/2)x + 1.90\nMultiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n1.56x - 40 = x + 3.80\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n0.56x - 40 = 3.80\nAdding 40 to both sides, we get:\n0.56x = 44.80\nDividing both sides by 0.56, we get:\nx = 80\nTherefore, the original price of the item was $80.\nThe answer is not listed, so there may be an error in the problem statement.'

"The yearly profit is equal to the monthly profit multiplied by 12. The monthly profit is equal to the revenue from sales minus the production costs. \n\nLet's assume the selling price per component is x. \n\nThe revenue from sales is equal to the selling price per component multiplied by the number of units produced each month, which is 420. \n\nThe production costs are equal to the production cost per component multiplied by the number of units produced each month, which is $110 multiplied by 420. \n\nTherefore, the monthly profit is equal to (x * 420) - (110 * 420) = 420x - 46,200. \n\nThe yearly profit is equal to 12 times the monthly profit, so it is equal to 12 * (420x - 46,200) = 5,040x - 554,400. \n\nWe want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we can set up the following inequality: \n\n5,040x - 554,400 ≥ 626,400. \n\nAdding 554,400 to both sides of the inequality, we get: \n\n5,040x ≥ 1,180,800. \n\nDividing both sides of the inequality by 5,040, we get: \n\nx ≥ 234. \n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234. \n\nThe closest answer choice is B) 230."

"Let's assume that the speed of the ship is x miles per hour. \n\nSince the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.\n\nLet's say it takes t hours for the ship and the plane to meet.\n\nIn t hours, the ship would have traveled a distance of 180t miles.\n\nIn t hours, the plane would have traveled a distance of (10x)t = 10xt miles.\n\nSince they meet at the same point, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane must be the same:\n\n180t = 10xt\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by t:\n\n180 = 10x\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n18 = x\n\nSo, the speed of the ship is 18 miles per hour.\n\nTo find the distance when they meet, we can substitute the speed of the ship into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship:\n\n180t = 18t\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by t:\n\n180 = 18\n\nTherefore, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 180 miles.\n\nThe correct answer is not among the answer choices provided."
"Let's assume the total deer population in the forest is x.\nIn 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. Therefore, the percentage of tagged deer in the forest in 2001 is 300/x * 100.\nIn 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and only 20 had tags from the previous year. Therefore, the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is 20/500 * 100 = 4%.\nAccording to the given information, the percentage of tagged deer in the forest in 2002 is representative of the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n300/x * 100 = 4\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n300 = 4x\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\nx = 75\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 75, which is not one of the answer choices."
"To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the arrival of the two trains.\n\nThe main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M. This means that the main line train arrives every 10 minutes, while the harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting from 5.02 A.M.\n\nLet's consider the time intervals between the arrival of the two trains:\n\n- From 5 o'clock to 5.02 A.M., there is a gap of 2 minutes.\n- From 5.02 A.M. to 5.12 A.M., both trains arrive at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the man has a 2-minute window to catch the first train.

"Let's start by finding the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let's call this number x.\nWe know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, so the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x.\nThe total number of files infected by a worm is the sum of the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm and the number of files infected only by a worm, so it is x + 2.5x = 3.5x.\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5 * 250 = 125.\nThe total number of files infected by either a virus or a worm is the sum of the number of files infected by a virus and the number of files infected by a worm, minus the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, so it is 125 + 3.5x - x = 125 + 2.5x.\nSince all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm, we have 125 + 2.5x = 250.\nSubtracting 125 from both sides, we get 2.5x = 125.\nDividing both sides by 2.5, we get x = 50.\nSo the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * 50 = 125.\nThe number of files not infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125.\nTherefore, the answer is E)125."

This can be represented as:\n\n$2272 \\equiv 875 \\pmod{N}$\n\nSince the remainder is the same, we can subtract the two equations:\n\n$2272 - 875 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$\n\n$1397 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$\n\nThis means that N is a factor of 1397.\n\nThe prime factorization of 1397 is $1397 = 17 \\cdot  82$.\n\nSince N is a 3-digit number, it cannot be equal to 1397. Therefore, N must be equal to 17 or 82.\n\nIf N = 17, the sum of the digits is $1+7=8$.\n\nIf N = 82, the sum of the digits is $8+2=10$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of N can be either 8 or 10.\n\nHowever, since the answer choices do not include 8, the sum of the digits of N must be 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) }10}$."
"Let's assume that there are a total of 100 students in the class.\n\nLet the number of passing students be x, and the number of failing students be y.\n\nAccording to the given information, the passing students had an average of 83, so the total score of the passing students is 83x.\nSimilarly, the failing students had an average of 55, so the total score of the failing students is 55y.\n\nThe overall class average is 76, so the total score of all the students is 76 * 100 = 7600.\n\nSince the total score of the passing students is 83x and the total score of the failing students is 55y, we can write the equation:\n\n83x + 55y = 7600\n\nWe also know that the number of passing students plus the number of failing students is equal to the total number of students in the class:\n\nx + y = 100\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 55, we get:\n\n55x + 55y = 5500\n\nSubtracting this equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n(83x + 55y) - (55x + 55y) = 7600 - 5500\n28x = 2100\nx = 75\n\nSo, there are 75 passing students.\n\nThe percentage of the class that passed is (75/100) * 100 = 75%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 75%."

'Let the average weight of the 10 oarsmen be $x$. Then the sum of their weights is $10x$. When the new man replaces one of the crew, the average weight increases to $x+1.8$. The sum of the weights of the 10 oarsmen plus the new man is $10(x+1.8)$. Since the sum of the weights of the 10 oarsmen plus the new man is equal to the sum of the weights of the 10 oarsmen plus the weight of the crew member who was replaced, we have $10(x+1.8)=10x+53$. Expanding the left side gives $10x+18=10x+53$. Subtracting $10x$ from both sides gives $18=53$, which is clearly false. Therefore, our assumption that the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man is incorrect. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }40}$.'
