"- The item is discounted by 22%\n- The customer uses a $20-off coupon\n- There is no tax on the item\n- The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item\n\nTo find the original price of the item, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's assume the original price of the item is x.\n2. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x (100% - 22% = 78% = 0.78).\n3. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price the customer pays is 0.78x - 20.\n4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the equation: 0.78x - 20 = (0.5x + 1.90).\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.28x = 21.90.\n6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.28, we find: x = 78.20.\n\nTherefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. The answer is E) $78.20."

There are z students in the class, where z > 5.\n\nTo find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest, and then divide it by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest.\n\nLet's denote the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest as S. We can express S in terms of x, y, and z.\n\n4. The sum of all the scores is y * z (since the average score for the entire class is y).\n5. The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since the average of the highest and lowest score is x).\n6. The sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest is S = y * z - 2x.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students excluding the highest and lowest. Since there are z students in total, and we are excluding 2 students (the highest and lowest scorers), the number of students excluding the highest and lowest is z - 2.\n\nFinally, we can find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers by dividing the sum S by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest (z - 2).\n\nTherefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, in terms of x, y, and z, is (y * z - 2x)/(z - 2).\n\nThe correct answer is option D: (zy – 2x)/(z - 2)."

'1. When folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm.\n2. When folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.\n3. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of all its sides.\n4. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.\n5. Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W.\n6. When folded along one set of sides, each part has a length of L/2 and a width of W.\n7. When folded along the other set of sides, each part has a length of L and a width of W/2.\n8. Using the formula for perimeter, we can set up the following equations:\n   - For folding along one set of sides: 48 = 2((L/2) + W)\n   - For folding along the other set of sides: 66 = 2(L + (W/2))\n9. Simplifying the equations:\n   - For folding along one set of sides: 48 = L + 2W\n   - For folding along the other set of sides: 66 = 2L + W\n10. Solving the system of equations:\n   - Multiply the first equation by 2: 96 = 2L + 4W\n   - Subtract the second equation from the multiplied first equation: 96 - 66 = 2L + 4W - (2L + W)\n   - Simplify: 30 = 3W\n   - Divide both sides by 3: W = 10\n   - Substitute the value of W into the first equation: 48 = L + 2(10)\n   - Simplify: 48 = L + 20\n   - Subtract 20 from both sides: 28 = L\n11. The length of the rectangle is 28 cm and the width is 10 cm.\n12. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.\n13.

"1. 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team.\n2. 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.\n\nTo find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to consider the students who are only members of the swim team and those who are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n\nLet's assume there are 100 students in total at Daifu university.\n\n1. 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means 24 students are members of both.\n2. Let's assume x% of students are only members of the swim team. This means x students are only members of the swim team.\n3. 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means 20% of x students are not members of the chess club, which is 0.2x students.\n4. The remaining (x - 0.2x) students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n\nSo, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is x + (x - 0.2x) = 2x - 0.2x = 1.8x.\n\nWe know that 24 students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, so 1.8x = 24.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 24 / 1.8 = 13.33.\n\nTherefore, approximately 13.33% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.\n\nSince this is not one of the answer choices, it seems there may be missing information or a mistake in the given information."

"1. There are two trains at the railway station - one in the harbor line and one in the main line.\n2. The main line train starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M.\n3. Both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes.\n4. The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes.\n\nTo calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the train arrivals.\n\nThe main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting from 5 o'clock. So, the possible arrival times for the main line train are 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, etc.\n\nThe harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting from 5.02 A.M. So, the possible arrival times for the harbor line train are 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, etc.\n\nSince the man wants to catch the first train that comes, he will catch the main line train if it arrives before the harbor line train. \n\nThe main line train arrives at 5:00, and the harbor line train arrives at 5:02. So, the man will catch the main line train if he arrives at the station before 5:02.\n\nThe probability of the man catching the first train is therefore the probability of him arriving at the station before 5:02.\n\nSince the man goes to the station every day, we can assume that his arrival time is uniformly distributed between 5:00 and 5:02.\n\nThe time interval between 5:00 and 5:02 is 2 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the ratio of the time he arrives before 5:02 (2 minutes) to the total time interval (2 minutes).\n\nProbability = 2 minutes / 2 minutes = 1\n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1.\n\nAnswer: E) 1"
'1. The average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons.\n2. The average weight increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy-duty truck was added.\n3. We need to find the weight of the heavy-duty truck.\n\nTo find the weight of the heavy-duty truck, we can use the concept of weighted averages. \n\nLet the weight of the heavy-duty truck be x tons.\n\nThe total weight of the 10 vehicles before the heavy-duty truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.\n\nAfter the heavy-duty truck was added, the total weight becomes 11 * (12.2 + 2.6) = 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.\n\nThe weight of the heavy-duty truck can be found by subtracting the total weight of the 10 vehicles from the total weight after the heavy-duty truck was added:\n\n162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.\n\nThe answer is A) 40.8.'

Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following equations:\n\nLet A be the amount of money Arjun has and S be the amount of money Sajal has.\n\n1. A - 30 = 2(S + 30)  (Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun after receiving $30)\n2. A + 10 = 3(S - 10)  (Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal after receiving $10)\n\nSimplifying the equations:\n\n1. A - 30 = 2S + 60\n2. A + 10 = 3S - 30\n\nRearranging the equations:\n\n1. A - 2S = 90\n2.

'1. M is a three-digit number.\n2. N is obtained by reversing the digits of M.\n3. M > N.\n4. M - N + 396c = 990, where c is a digit.\n5. We need to find the number of values of M that are more than 300.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the possible values of c.\n- Since c is a digit, it can take on values from 0 to 9.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible values of M and N.\n- Since M is a three-digit number, it can range from 100 to 999.\n- N is obtained by reversing the digits of M, so it will also be a three-digit number.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions for M > N.\n- Since M is a three-digit number and N is obtained by reversing the digits of M, M will always be greater than N.\n\nStep 4: Determine the conditions for M - N + 396c = 990.\n- Rearranging the equation, we get M - N = 990 - 396c.\n- Since M > N, the left side of the equation will always be positive.\n- Therefore, 990 - 396c must be positive, which means c must be less than or equal to 2.\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of values of M that are more than 300.\n- Since M is a three-digit number, it can range from 100 to 999.\n- We need to find the number of values of M that are more than 300.\n- To do this, we can subtract the number of values of M that are less than or equal to 300 from the total number of possible values of M.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 700 (total number of possible values of M) - 300 (number of values of M that are less than or equal to 300) = 400.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) None.'

Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC.\n\nLet the measure of minor arc AB be x. Then, the measure of minor arc BC is also x.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + x + 160° + 150° = 360°\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2x + 310° = 360°\n\nSubtracting 310° from both sides:\n\n2x = 50°\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 25°\n\nSince minor arc AB is 25°, minor arc AD is equal to the sum of minor arc AB and minor arc BD:\n\n25° + 150° = 175°\n\nTherefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 175°.\n\nThe answer is not listed in the answer choices provided.'

"1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.\n2. Once he reached B, he turned right around with a pause.\n3. He returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.\n4. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that Kevin traveled for a certain amount of time from A to B at a speed of 70 mph. Then, he turned around and traveled for the same amount of time from B to A at a speed of 90 mph. Three hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from point B.\n\nTo find the distance between points A and B, we need to determine the total time Kevin traveled. Let's assume the total time is T hours.\n\nFrom A to B, Kevin traveled at a speed of 70 mph for T hours. Therefore, the distance from A to B is 70T miles.\n\nFrom B to A, Kevin traveled at a speed of 90 mph for T hours. Therefore, the distance from B to A is 90T miles.\n\nThree hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from point B. This means that the distance from B to A is 70 miles less than the distance from A to B.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation: 90T = 70T + 70\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 20T = 70\n\nDividing both sides by 20, we find: T = 3.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance from A to B: 70T = 70 * 3.5 = 245 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between points A and B is 245 miles.\n\nThe correct answer is E) None of the above."

Peter has a 5/6 probability of answering correctly by performing calculations.\n4. We want to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nTo find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to subtract the probability of cheating from the total probability of answering correctly.\n\nThe probability of Alan guessing correctly is 1/5.\nThe probability of Roger cheating and answering correctly is 2/3.\nThe probability of Peter answering correctly by performing calculations is 5/6.\n\nThe total probability of answering correctly is the sum of these probabilities: 1/5 + 2/3 + 5/6 = 13/15.\n\nTo find the probability of answering correctly, but not via cheating, we subtract the probability of cheating from the total probability of answering correctly: 13/15 - 2/3 = 13/15 - 10/15 = 3/15 = 1/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 1/5.\n\nThe answer is A) 1/18.'
"1. Principal amount (P) = Rs. 5000\n2. Time period (t) = 2 years\n3. Difference between simple interest and compound interest = Rs. 72\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of interest (R).\n\nLet's calculate the simple interest (SI) first:\nSI = (P * R * t) / 100\n\nNext, let's calculate the compound interest (CI):\nCI = P * (1 + R/100)^t - P\n\nGiven that the difference between SI and CI is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:\nCI - SI = 72\n\nSubstituting the values:\n(P * (1 + R/100)^t - P) - ((P * R * t) / 100) = 72\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n(P * (1 + R/100)^t) - (P + (P * R * t) / 100) = 72\n\nSince P is common in both terms, we can cancel it out:\n(1 + R/100)^t - (1 + (R * t) / 100) = 72/P\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of P and t:\n(1 + R/100)^2 - (1 + (R * 2) / 100) = 72/5000\n\nSimplifying further:\n(1 + R/100)^2 - (1 + 2R/100) = 72/5000\n\nExpanding the square:\n1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 - 1 - 2R/100 = 72/5000\n\nCanceling out the common terms:\n(R/100)^2 = 72/5000\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\nR/100 = √(72/5000)\n\nSimplifying:\nR/100 = √(9/625)\n\nR/100 = 3/25\n\nCross-multiplying:\n25R = 300\n\nDividing by 25:\nR = 12\n\nTherefore, the rate of interest is 12%.\n\nAnswer: B) 12%"
"1. There are a total of 250 files on Sam's hard drive.\n2. All 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.\n3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n4. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.\n5. The question is asking for the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a Venn diagram to represent the different categories of files:\n\nLet's assume the number of files infected only by a worm is x.\nThen, the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x/2.5.\nThe number of files infected only by a virus would be 250 - x - x/2.5.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected only by a worm plus the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is equal to 50% of the total number of files.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\nx + x/2.5 = 0.5 * 250\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n2.5x + x = 125\n3.5x = 125\nx = 125/3.5\nx ≈ 35.71\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a file, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 36.\n\nTherefore, the number of files infected only by a worm is approximately 36.\nThe number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is approximately 36/2.5 = 14.4, which we can round to 14.\n\nThe number of files infected only by a virus would be 250 - 36 - 14 = 200.\n\nTo find the number of files not infected by a worm, we subtract the number of files infected only by a worm and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm from the total number of files:\n250 - 36 - 14 = 200.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 200 files were NOT infected by a worm."

'1. The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.\n2. We need to find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain.\n3. We can convert the rate from seconds to minutes by dividing x by 60.\n4. The rate in gallons per minute is w/25 divided by x/60, which simplifies to 60w/25x.\n5. To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we divide y by the rate of gallons per minute.\n6. The time in minutes is y divided by 60w/25x, which simplifies to 25xy/60w.\n7. Simplifying further, we get 5xy/(12w).\n8. Therefore, the answer is C) 5xy/(12w).'

'1. The quadratic equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0.\n2. The equation needs to have two real and distinct roots.\n3. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n4. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant needs to be greater than zero.\n5. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.\n6. The discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k.\n7. The discriminant needs to be greater than zero, so 25 - 4k > 0.\n8. Solving the inequality, we get 4k < 25, which simplifies to k < 6.25.\n9. The largest integral value of k that satisfies the inequality is k = 6.\n10. However, the question asks for the largest integral value of k, so we need to find the largest integer less than 6, which is 5.\n11. Therefore, the largest integral value of k for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 5.\n12. None of the answer choices match the correct answer.'

"- 60% of the people who took the survey were women.\n- Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.\n- 10 men liked green cars more than red.\n\nTo find the total number of people who took the survey, we need to find the number of men who took the survey and the number of women who took the survey.\n\nLet's assume the total number of people who took the survey is x.\n\n- 60% of x were women, so the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x.\n- The remaining 40% of x were men, so the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x.\n\nOf the men who took the survey, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x.\n\nWe are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. So, the number of men who preferred green cars is 10.\n\nTherefore, the total number of men who took the survey is 0.3x + 10.\n\nThe total number of people who took the survey is the sum of the number of men and the number of women:\n\n0.3x + 10 + 0.6x = x\n\n0.9x + 10 = x\n\n10 = 0.1x\n\nx = 100\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100.\n\nThe answer is A) 100."
