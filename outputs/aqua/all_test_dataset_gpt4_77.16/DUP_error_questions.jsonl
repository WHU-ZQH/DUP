After the price decrease, the price of each article is 85% of the original price, or 0.85x. \n\nAccording to the problem, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the total cost of 5 articles at the new price is equal to $300. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n\n5 * 0.85x = 300 \n\nSolving this equation for x gives us the original price of each article. \n\n0.85x = 300 / 5 \n\n0.85x = 60 \n\nx = 60 / 0.85 \n\nx = $70.59 (approximately)\n\nSo, the original price of each article was approximately $70.59. \n\nThe new price of each article, after the 15% decrease, is 85% of this original price. \n\nNew price = 0.85 * $70.59 = $59.99 (approximately)\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. \n\nIf we assume that the total cost of the 5 additional articles is equal to the amount saved by the price decrease (which is not stated in the problem, but could be a possible interpretation), we can set up a different equation. \n\nIn this case, the amount saved on each article is 15% of the original price, or 0.15x. The total savings for 5 articles is then 5 * 0.15x = 0.75x. \n\nSetting this equal to $300 gives us the equation:\n\n0.75x = 300 \n\nSolving for x gives us the original price:\n\nx = 300 / 0.75 \n\nx = $400 \n\nThe new price, after the 15% decrease, is then:\n\nNew price = 0.85 * $400 = $340 \n\nAgain, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nWithout additional information or clarification, it's not possible to match the problem to one of the given answer choices.", "error_answer": "A"}

According to the problem, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. \n\nSince 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, this means that 50% of the files, or 125 files, were infected by a virus. These files are either infected by both a virus and a worm (x files) or only by a virus. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected only by a virus is 125 - x - 2.5x = 125 - 3.5x.\n\nHowever, since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both, the number of files infected only by a virus must be 0. \n\nSo, we have the equation 125 - 3.5x = 0. Solving for x gives x = 125 / 3.5 = 35.71. However, the number of files must be an integer, so we round this to 36. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 36, and the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * 36 = 90. \n\nThe total number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm) is 90 + 36 = 126. \n\nTherefore, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is the total number of files minus the number of files infected by a worm, or 250 - 126 = 124. \n\nHowever, since the number of files must be an integer, we round this to 125. \n\nSo, the answer is E) 125.", "error_answer": "E"}

We know that $s = 2a$ (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum) and that the total weight of the coin is $30$ grams. \n\nSo, we can write the equation: $56.25\\pi a + 56.25\\pi \\cdot 2a = 30$.

Let's take x = 0.5 and y = 0.4 as an example. In this case, [x] = 0, [y] = 0, [x+y] = 0, [2x] = 1, and [2y] = 0. So, L(x,y) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 and R(x,y) = 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y).\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where x and y are such that x + y > 1 but x, y < 1. Let's take x = 0.6 and y = 0.7 as an example. In this case, [x] = 0, [y] = 0, [x+y] = 1, [2x] = 1, and [2y] = 1. So, L(x,y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 and R(x,y) = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) > R(x,y).\n\nSo, it is not impossible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y), L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y), L(x,y) < R(x,y), or L(x,y) > R(x,y).

These files are either infected by both a virus and a worm (x files) or only by a virus. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected only by a virus is 125 - x - 2.5x = 125 - 3.5x.\n\nHowever, since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both, the number of files infected only by a virus must be 0. \n\nSo, we have the equation 125 - 3.5x = 0.
