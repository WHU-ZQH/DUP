'Let the height of the tower be $h$ and the distance from the car to the tower be $x$. Then, we have the following two equations from the given information:\n\\[\\tan 45^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x} \\implies h = x\\]\n\\[\\tan 60^\\circ = \\frac{h}{x - \\text{distance traveled in 10 minutes}} \\implies \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{x}{x - \\text{distance traveled in 10 minutes}}\\]\nSolving the second equation for the distance traveled in 10 minutes, we get\n\\[x - \\text{distance traveled in 10 minutes} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies \\text{distance traveled in 10 minutes} = x\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\]\nLet $t$ be the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. Then, the car travels a distance of $x$ in time $t + 10$ minutes, so its speed is $\\frac{x}{t + 10}$. Setting this equal to the speed found above, we get\n\\[\\frac{x}{t + 10} = \\frac{x\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10} \\implies t + 10 = 10\\sqrt{3} \\implies t = 10\\sqrt{3} - 10 = 10(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\\]\nConverting this to the form in the answer choices, we get $t = 10\\sqrt{3} - 10 = 5(2\\sqrt{3} - 2) = 5(2(\\sqrt{3} - 1)) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }8(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}$.'

'The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is when the two events are independent. In this case, the probability that neither event will occur is the product of the probabilities that each event will not occur. \n\nThe probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. The probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \n\nTherefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. This is because the question is asking for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur, not the exact value. \n\nThe greatest value that is less than 0.1144 among the answer choices is 0.11, but this is not one of the answer choices either. \n\nTherefore, the question may have a mistake.

"Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35.\n\nWe also know that the time spent by Alex and Jacob is approximately the same. This means that A/7 ≈ J/9.\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the number of toys made by Jacob.\n\nFirst, let's express A from the first equation: A = 35 - J.\n\nNow we can substitute A in the second equation: (35 - J)/7 ≈ J/9.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 63 (which is the least common multiple of 7 and 9) to get rid of the fractions: 9*(35 - J) ≈ 7*J.\n\nThis simplifies to 315 - 9J ≈ 7J.\n\nAdding 9J to both sides gives 315 ≈ 16J.\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 16 gives J ≈ 315/16 ≈ 19.7.\n\nSince Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round this number down to the nearest whole number, which is 19.\n\nSo, Jacob made approximately 19 toys, which is answer choice E."

"Let's denote the sides of the rectangle as a and b. When the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm, so we have the equation:\n\n2a + b = 48\n\nWhen the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm, so we have the equation:\n\na + 2b = 66\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n4a + 2b = 96\n\nSubtracting the second equation from this, we get:\n\n3a = 30\n\nSo, a = 10 cm.

'First, subtract the initial charge from your total amount of money: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. This is the amount of money you have left to spend on additional quarter-miles.\n\nNext, divide this amount by the cost per additional quarter-mile: $5.00 ÷ $0.10 = 50. This is the number of additional quarter-miles you can afford.\n\nSince each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, you can afford to travel 50 additional quarter-miles. \n\nTo convert this to miles, multiply by 4 (since there are 4 quarter-miles in a mile): 50 ÷ 4 = 12.5 miles.\n\nFinally, add the initial quarter-mile that you get for the initial charge: 12.5 miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles.\n\nSo, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

Karan wants to make a 20% profit on this, which means he wants to sell the machine for 120% of the cost price. \n\n120% of Rs. 1200 = 120/100 * 1200 = Rs. 1440\n\nThis is the price after the discount has been applied. If the discount is 20%, this means the marked price is 100% - 20% = 80% of the marked price. \n\nSo, Rs. 1440 is 80% of the marked price. \n\nTo find 100% of the marked price (i.e., the marked price itself), we can set up the equation:\n\n1440 = 0.80 * marked price\n\nSolving for marked price gives:\n\nmarked price = 1440 / 0.80 = Rs. 1800\n\nSo, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount. \n\nThe correct answer is E)1,800.'
'Train A has a head start of 3 hours before Train B starts. In these 3 hours, Train A would have covered a distance of 3*40 = 120 km.\n\nNow, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is 72-40 = 32 kmph.\n\nThe time it would take for Train B to cover the distance of 120 km (the head start of Train A) at a relative speed of 32 kmph is 120/32 = 3.75 hours.\n\nTrain B starts at 2 pm, so it would meet Train A at 2 pm + 3.75 hours = 5:45 pm on the same day.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E) None of these.'

'Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, if there were initially 64 water lilies on the lake, the lake would be fully covered in 60 - 6*2 = 48 days. This is because 64 is 2^6 times larger than 1, so it would take 6*2 = 12 fewer days for the lake to be fully covered. However, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nThe correct approach is to realize that if the lake is fully covered in 60 days with one lily, then it would be fully covered in 60 - 6 = 54 days with 64 lilies, because 64 is 2^6 times larger than 1. However, this is also not one of the answer choices. \n\nThe correct answer is E) 59 days. This is because the number of lilies doubles every two days, so the lake would be half covered in 59 days. If there were initially 64 lilies, then the lake would be fully covered in 59 days, because 64 is more than half of the number of lilies needed to fully cover the lake.'

'The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost per meter is Rs.2. Therefore, the total length of paper used is 260/2 = 130 meters.\n\nSince the paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5 meters, the total area of the paper used is 130*0.5 = 65 square meters.\n\nThe area of the walls is 65 square meters, but we need to add the area of the doors and windows, which is 15 square meters. Therefore, the total area of the walls is 65+15 = 80 square meters.\n\nThe area of the walls is the product of the height and the semi-perimeter of the room.

"The 10kg mixture contains 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the clay and replace it with sand.\n\nLet's denote the amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand as x kg. Since we are removing a mixture of 30% sand and 70% clay, we are removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay.\n\nAfter the replacement, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 3kg - 0.3x kg (removed) + x kg (added) = 3kg + 0.7x kg. The amount of clay will be 7kg - 0.7x kg = 7kg - 0.7x kg.\n\nWe want these two amounts to be equal, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3kg + 0.7x kg = 7kg - 0.7x kg\n\nSolving this equation gives x = 20/7 kg.\n\nSo, the answer is B) 20/7 kg."

"Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. \n\nSince the coin was flipped 20 times, we know that H + T = 20. \n\nAlso, since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount, the total amount of money exchanged must be equal. This means that the amount of money Christopher gave to Jonathan ($2 per heads) must be equal to the amount of money Jonathan gave to Christopher ($3 per tails). So, we have 2H = 3T. \n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of H. \n\nSubstituting T = 20 - H into the second equation gives us 2H = 3(20 - H). \n\nSolving this equation gives us 2H = 60 - 3H, or 5H = 60. \n\nTherefore, H = 60 / 5 = 12. \n\nSo, the coin landed on heads 12 times. \n\nThe answer is E)12."

"The bond is compounded semi-annually, so the interest rate is divided by 2 and the number of periods is multiplied by 2. \n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\nA = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\nP = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)\nr = annual interest rate (in decimal)\nn = number of times that interest is compounded per year \nt = time the money is invested for in years\n\nIn this case, P = $5000, r = 12% or 0.12, n = 2 (since it's compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year.\n\nSo, A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2 = 5000(1.06)^2 = 5000 * 1.1236 = $5618.\n\nThe interest accrued is the final amount minus the initial principal, so the interest is $5618 - $5000 = $618.\n\nSo, the answer is B) $618."
'The multiplication table represents the following:\n\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nEach letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. The multiplication is done in the traditional way, where E times D gives the last digit D and E times A gives the digit A, and so on. \n\nFrom the last digit D in the first row, we can see that E must be 1 because any number times 1 gives the same number. \n\nSo, the multiplication table becomes:\n\nM A D\nB 1\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nThen, from the second row, we can see that B times D gives D and B times A gives A.

"The rectangular plot has a perimeter of 340 metres. Let's denote the length of the plot as L and the width as W. \n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(L+W). So, 2*(L+W) = 340, which simplifies to L+W = 170.\n\nThe 1-metre broad boundary around the plot will increase the length and the width of the plot by 2 metres each (1 metre on each side). So, the length of the plot including the boundary is L+2 and the width is W+2.\n\nThe area of the boundary is the difference between the area of the plot including the boundary and the area of the plot itself. \n\nThe area of the plot including the boundary is (L+2)*(W+2) and the area of the plot itself is L*W. \n\nSo, the area of the boundary is (L+2)*(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W + 4 - L*W = 2*(L+W) + 4 - L*W = 2*170 + 4 - L*W = 340 + 4 - L*W = 344 - L*W.\n\nSince we don't know the values of L and W, we cannot determine the area of the boundary and hence, we cannot determine the cost of gardening the boundary.\n\nSo, the answer is D) Cannot be determined."

"The father wants to divide the money in such a way that both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years.\n\nLet's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100.\n\nThe compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nSince the interest is compounded annually (n=1), and the interest rate is 4% (r=0.04), the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t.\n\nWe know that both sons will have the same amount of money when they turn 26, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nM(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nSubstituting S = 5100 - M into the equation, we get:\n\nM(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nSolving this equation for M, we get M ≈ 2600.\n\nSo, Mohan's share is approximately Rs. 2600.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)2600."

"Let's denote the number as x. According to the problem, we can write down the following equation: 2/3*x - 10 = 40 + 1/3*x. \n\nTo solve this equation, we first get rid of the fractions by multiplying every term by 3: 2x - 30 = 120 + x. \n\nThen, we subtract x from both sides of the equation: x - 30 = 120. \n\nFinally, we add 30 to both sides of the equation to find x: x = 150. \n\nSo, the number is 150, which corresponds to answer choice C) 150."

'Shweta covers 15 km in 1.5 hours (since she rides at 10 km per hour) and then takes a 10-minute (or 1/6 hour) rest. So, to cover 15 km, she takes 1.5 hours + 1/6 hour = 1.6667 hours.\n\nTo cover 100 km, she will need to repeat this process 100/15 = 6.6667 times. \n\nSo, the total time she will take is 6.6667 * 1.6667 = 11.1111 hours.\n\nRounding up to the nearest hour, she will take approximately 11 hours to cover 100 km.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 11 hours.'
'The time it takes for Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city and return by car is 17 hours. If he travels both ways by train, he loses 4 hours, meaning it takes him 21 hours. Therefore, the time it takes for him to travel one way by train is 21/2 = 10.5 hours.\n\nSince the time it takes for him to travel one way by train and return by car is 17 hours, the time it takes for him to travel one way by car is 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, if he had traveled by car both ways, it would have taken him 6.5 * 2 = 13 hours.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 13 hrs.'
'The dog eats at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, 11:00 am, and 12:00 pm. This is a total of 5 times. Each time, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, so the amount of food left is multiplied by 2/3 each time. \n\nSo, the amount of food left right before the dog began to eat at noon is $(2/3)^5 = 32/243 \\approx 0.1316872427983539$ or approximately 13.17% of the original amount. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices.
