"Let's denote the height of the tower as $h$, the initial distance from the car to the tower as $d_1$, and the distance from the car to the tower after 10 minutes as $d_2$. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that the car is moving at a constant speed, so the ratio of the distances the car travels is equal to the ratio of the times it takes to travel those distances. \n\nWe can use the tangent of the angles of elevation to express $d_1$ and $d_2$ in terms of $h$:\n\n$\\tan 45° = \\frac{h}{d_1} \\Rightarrow d_1 = h$\n\n$\\tan 60° = \\frac{h}{d_2} \\Rightarrow d_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nThe car travels a distance of $d_1 - d_2 = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$ in 10 minutes. \n\nLet $t$ be the additional time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower. In this time, the car will travel a distance of $d_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$. \n\nSetting up the ratio, we get:\n\n$\\frac{h\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{t}$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = 10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}}\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}^2}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\\right)$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it, we get:\n\n$t = 10\\left(\\frac{3(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1}\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3} + 3}{2}\\right) = 5(3\\sqrt{3} + 3)$\n\nSo, the additional time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is $5(3\\sqrt{3} + 3)$ minutes. \n\nHowever, this answer is not in the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. The correct answer should be $5(3\\sqrt{3} + 3)$ minutes."
"Let's denote the original price of the item as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, the item was first discounted by 22%, which means the price became 78% of the original price, or 0.78x. \n\nThen, a $20-off coupon was applied, so the price became 0.78x - $20. \n\nFinally, it's given that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. So, we can write the equation as follows:\n\n0.78x - $20 = 0.5x + $1.90\n\nSolving this equation for x gives:\n\n0.78x - 0.5x = $20 + $1.90\n\n0.28x = $21.90\n\nx = $21.90 / 0.28\n\nx = $78.20\n\nSo, the original price of the item was $78.20. The answer is E) $78.20."
'The value that is a multiple of X, if X is divisible by 9 and 12, is A) 36. \n\nAs per the hint, the number X must be divisible by both 9 and 12. This means that X must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. The LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. Therefore, X must be a multiple of 36. \n\nFrom the given options, only 36 is a multiple of 36. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 36.'
'The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. Similarly, the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n\nThe probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each event not occurring, assuming that the two events are independent. Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. This is because the two events are not necessarily independent. If the two events are not independent, then the probability that neither event will occur could be greater than 0.1144.\n\nThe greatest possible value for the probability that neither event will occur is the minimum of the probabilities that each event will not occur. This is because if the two events are negatively correlated (i.e., if one event occurring makes the other event less likely to occur), then the probability that neither event will occur could be as high as the probability that the most likely event will not occur.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.44, which is not one of the answer choices. The closest answer choice is 0.46, but this is greater than 0.44, so it cannot be correct.\n\nThe next greatest possible value is the probability that Stock B will not increase in value, which is 0.26. This is one of the answer choices, so the correct answer is B) 0.26.'
"The selling price of the article is Rs.360, which is 120% of the cost price (100% cost price + 20% profit). \n\nLet's denote the cost price as x. \n\nSo, 120% of x = Rs.360 \n\nTo find the cost price, we need to find 100% of x. \n\nFirst, let's convert 120% to a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives us 1.2. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation 1.2x = 360 \n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2 \n\nx = 360 / 1.2 \n\nx = Rs.300 \n\nSo, the cost price of the article is Rs.300. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)300."
'The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1 out of 20, or 5%. \n\nIf this percentage represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, then the 20 black marbles that were initially put back into the bag represent 5% of the total number of marbles in the bag.\n\nTo find the total number of marbles in the bag, we can set up the equation:\n\n20 (number of black marbles) = 0.05 * Q (total number of marbles)\n\nSolving for Q gives us:\n\nQ = 20 / 0.05 = 400\n\nSo, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

'The bike number format is 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. \n\nThere are 26 possible letters (A-Z) and 10 possible numbers (0-9). \n\nFor the first letter, we have 26 choices. For the second letter, we also have 26 choices because the letters can be the same. \n\nFor the first number, we have 10 choices (0-9). For the second number, we also have 10 choices because the numbers can be the same. \n\nSo, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26*26*10*10 = 67600. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. This is because the question also asks how many letters need to be distinct. \n\nIf we assume that the two letters need to be distinct, then for the first letter we have 26 choices, but for the second letter we only have 25 choices (because it cannot be the same as the first letter). \n\nSo, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed if the letters need to be distinct is 26*25*10*10 = 65000. \n\nSo, the answer is D)65000. \n\nIn terms of how many letters need to be distinct, the answer is that both letters need to be distinct.'
'The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.\n\nThe train covers a quarter of the distance before it starts raining, which is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.\n\nThe time it takes to cover this distance at the initial speed is 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.\n\nThe remaining distance after it starts raining is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.\n\nThe time it takes to cover this distance at the reduced speed is 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.\n\nSo, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 12.5 hours.'

'The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year, it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units.\n\nThe production cost for each unit is $110, so the total production cost for a year is 5040 * $110 = $554,400.\n\nThe company wants to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. So, the total revenue (sales) the company needs to make in a year is the production cost plus the desired profit, which is $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue needed by the number of units produced in a year. So, $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29.\n\nSince the selling price per component must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest dollar to ensure the company makes at least the desired profit. So, the minimum selling price per component is $235.\n\nHowever, this option is not available in the answer choices. The closest option that is greater than $235 is $240. Therefore, the answer is C) $240.'
"Let's denote the total number of staplers produced that day as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, which means that 90 percent of them were non-defective. So, the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9x.\n\nThe problem also states that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 0.02*0.9x.\n\nWe know that this number is 72, so we can set up the equation 0.02*0.9x = 72.\n\nSolving this equation for x gives us x = 72 / (0.02*0.9) = 4000.\n\nSo, the total number of staplers produced that day was 4000, which is answer choice A."
'Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 1 minute, it produces 1/6 of a yo-yo. Similarly, Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 1 minute, it produces 1/9 of a yo-yo.\n\nTogether, in 1 minute, they produce 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18 of a yo-yo.\n\nTo produce 10 yo-yos, they will need 10 / (5/18) = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is C) 36 minutes.'

'The word "PROBLEC" has 7 unique letters. We are asked to find the number of ways these letters can be rearranged to form new 7-letter words, with no repetition of letters.\n\nThis is a permutation problem, as the order of the letters matters. The formula for permutations of n unique items taken r at a time is nPr = n! / (n-r)!. \n\nIn this case, both n and r are 7, so the formula simplifies to 7!. \n\nThe factorial function (denoted by !) means to multiply a series of descending natural numbers. 7! is equal to 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040.\n\nTherefore, there are 5040 ways to rearrange the letters of the word "PROBLEC" to form new 7-letter words, with no repetition of letters.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C) 7!.'

"The speed of the elevator can be determined by comparing the two scenarios. \n\nIn the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and then stop, allowing the elevator to carry you the rest of the way to the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator travels the equivalent of 20 steps in 10 minutes, or 2 steps per minute.\n\nIn the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, allowing the elevator to carry you the rest of the way to the ground in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator travels the equivalent of 10 steps in 20 minutes, or 0.5 steps per minute.\n\nThe discrepancy between these two scenarios suggests that your walking speed is also a factor. If we subtract the elevator's contribution from the total steps in each scenario, we can find your walking speed.\n\nIn the first scenario, you walk 20 steps in 10 minutes, or 2 steps per minute. Subtracting the elevator's contribution (2 steps per minute), we find that you walk at a speed of 0 steps per minute.\n\nIn the second scenario, you walk 10 steps in 20 minutes, or 0.5 steps per minute. Subtracting the elevator's contribution (0.5 steps per minute), we find that you walk at a speed of 0 steps per minute.\n\nThis confirms that the elevator's speed is 2 steps per minute, as it is the only consistent factor in both scenarios.\n\nSo, the answer is B) 2 step/minute."
'The average number of microwave ovens sold per month is calculated by dividing the total number of ovens sold by the total number of months.\n\n1. Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months. So, the total number of ovens sold last year is 42 ovens/month * 12 months = 504 ovens.\n\n2. This year, in the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year is 20 ovens/month * 10 months = 200 ovens.\n\n3. The total number of ovens sold in the 22 months period is 504 ovens (last year) + 200 ovens (this year) = 704 ovens.\n\n4. Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 704 ovens / 22 months = 32 ovens/month.\n\nSo, the answer is D) 32.'
'The average of the highest and lowest scores is x. This means that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since the average is the sum divided by the number of elements, in this case 2).\n\nThe average score for the entire class is y. This means that the sum of all the scores is zy (since the average is the sum divided by the number of elements, in this case z).\n\nWe want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. This means we need to subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores from the sum of all the scores, and then divide by the number of remaining students.\n\nThe sum of all the scores is zy, and the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x. So, the sum of the scores of the remaining students is zy - 2x.\n\nThe number of remaining students is z - 2 (since we are excluding the highest and lowest scorers).\n\nTherefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).\n\nSo, the answer is D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).'

"Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35 toys.\n\nSince they worked for almost the same number of hours, the time Alex spent making toys is approximately equal to the time Jacob spent making toys. We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. Therefore, 7A ≈ 9J.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's express A from the first equation: A = 35 - J. Now we can substitute A in the second equation: 7(35 - J) ≈ 9J. This simplifies to 245 - 7J ≈ 9J.\n\nAdding 7J to both sides gives 245 ≈ 16J. Dividing both sides by 16 gives J ≈ 15.3. Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round this to the nearest whole number. \n\nSo, Jacob made approximately 15 toys. \n\nAnswer: A) 15."
"John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. This means that half of the solution is tea and the other half is milk.\n\nFirst, he replaces 15% of the solution with milk. This means that he is removing 15% of the tea and replacing it with milk. So, the new concentration of tea is 50% * (1 - 0.15) = 42.5%.\n\nHe does this again, so the concentration of tea becomes 42.5% * (1 - 0.15) = 36.125%.\n\nFinally, he replaces 10% of the solution with milk. This means that he is removing 10% of the tea and replacing it with milk. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125% * (1 - 0.10) = 32.51%.\n\nSo, the final concentration of tea in John's drink is 32.51%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 32.51%."
"The total number of students must be a multiple of 16, 10, and 8, since fractions of students are not possible. The least common multiple of these numbers is 80. \n\nThe smallest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 1000, but 1000 is not a multiple of 80. The next multiple of 80 is 1080. \n\nThe largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 is 10000, but 10000 is not a 4-digit number. The previous multiple of 80 is 9920. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 9920 - 1080 = 8840. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. It's possible that there may be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If we consider the smallest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 80 to be 1000 (even though it's not a multiple of 80), then the difference would be 9920 - 1000 = 8920, which is also not one of the answer choices. \n\nWithout additional information or clarification, it's not possible to determine the correct answer from the given choices."

"Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as x km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey is x + 12 km/hr.\n\nThe distance travelled during the forward journey is the speed multiplied by the time, which is 6x. The distance travelled during the return journey is (x + 12) multiplied by 4, which is 4x + 48.\n\nSince the distance travelled during the forward journey and the return journey is the same, we can set up the equation 6x = 4x + 48. Solving this equation for x gives x = 24 km/hr.\n\nTherefore, the total distance travelled by the jeep is 6x (forward journey) + 4(x + 12) (return journey) = 6*24 + 4*(24 + 12) = 144 + 144 = 288 km.\n\nSo, the total distance travelled by the jeep is 288 km.

"Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. \n\nAccording to the problem, the original retail price of the appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. So, the original retail price would be $100 + 60% of $100 = $160.\n\nThe appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. So, the selling price would be $160 - 20% of $160 = $128.\n\nNow, we need to find out the percentage by which the selling price is more than the wholesale cost. \n\nThe difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is $128 - $100 = $28.\n\nTo find out the percentage, we divide the difference by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100. \n\nSo, the percentage is ($28/$100) * 100 = 28%.\n\nTherefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 28%."

So we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.95x - 0.93x = 15\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n0.02x = 15\n\nx = 15 / 0.02\n\nx = Rs. 750\n\nSo, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. The correct answer is D) Rs. 750."
'The difference between the correct and incorrect calculation is 770. This difference is equivalent to the difference between 7/8 and 7/18 of the number. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n\n7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. \n\nSo, the equation becomes: \n\n63/72 * x - 28/72 * x = 770\n\nSubtracting the fractions gives:\n\n35/72 * x = 770\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:\n\nx = 770 * 72/35\n\nSolving for x gives:\n\nx = 1584\n\nSo, the original number is 1584. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 1584.'
"The shop assistant's monthly salary is made up of a fixed salary of $500 and 5% of all monthly sales. If she wants her monthly salary to reach $1500, the amount from the sales should be $1500 - $500 = $1000.\n\nLet's denote the monthly sales as x. We know that 5% of x is $1000. We can write this as an equation: 0.05x = $1000.\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.05: x = $1000 / 0.05 = $20000.\n\nTherefore, the shop assistant needs to have monthly sales of $20000 in order for her monthly salary to reach $1500.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) $20000."
"The average speed of an object moving along a path is given by the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken.\n\nSince the aeroplane is flying along the four sides of a square, the total distance travelled is 4 times the length of one side of the square. Let's assume the length of one side of the square to be 'd' km. So, the total distance travelled is 4d km.\n\nThe time taken to travel each side of the square is the distance (d) divided by the speed. So, the total time taken is:\n\nTime = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800 = d(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) = d(0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.00167 + 0.00125) = d*0.01042 hours\n\nSo, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 4d / (d*0.01042) = 4 / 0.01042 = 384 km/hr\n\nSo, the average speed of the plane around the field is 384 km/hr. Therefore, the answer is (A) 384."
"Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that:\n\nW + B = 18 (since Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners)\n\nLet's denote the cost of each brown sharpener as X rupees. Therefore, the cost of each white sharpener is X + 1 rupees. The total cost of the sharpeners is 100 rupees, so:\n\nB*X + W*(X + 1) = 100\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (W, B, and X), so we can solve this system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's express B from the first equation:\n\nB = 18 - W\n\nNow, let's substitute B in the second equation:\n\n(18 - W)*X + W*(X + 1) = 100\n\nLet's open the brackets:\n\n18X - WX + WX + W = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n18X + W = 100\n\nWe know that X, W, and B are integers (since they represent the number of sharpeners and the cost in rupees), so we can start checking possible values for W (from 1 to 18) and see if we get an integer value for X.\n\nIf we try W = 10, we get:\n\n18X + 10 = 100\n\n18X = 90\n\nX = 90 / 18 = 5\n\nSo, the cost of each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, and the cost of each white sharpener is 6 rupees. This satisfies the condition that the white sharpener is 1 rupee more expensive than the brown one.\n\nTherefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.\n\nSo, the answer is A)10,8."
'Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so in 1 hour, it can fill 1/8 of the pool. \n\nIn the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2*(1/8) = 1/4 of the pool. \n\nSo, 3/4 of the pool was left to be filled by both hoses A and B in the next 3 hours. \n\nTogether, hoses A and B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, so in 1 hour, they can fill (3/4)/3 = 1/4 of the pool. \n\nSince hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour, the rate at which hose B fills the pool is (1/4 - 1/8) = 1/8 of the pool per hour. \n\nTherefore, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone. \n\nSo, the answer is A) 8.'
'The original number is 120 and the reduced number is 96. The reduction is therefore 120 - 96 = 24. \n\nTo find the reduction percent, we divide the reduction by the original number and multiply by 100%. \n\nSo, the reduction percent is (24/120) x 100% = 20%.\n\nTherefore, the reduction percent when 120 is reduced to 96 is 20%. \n\nSo, the answer is C)20%.'
"The number is A) 42857.\n\nHere's why:\n\nLet's denote the 5-digit number as N. When a 1 is added after it, the number becomes 10N + 1. When a 1 is added before it, the number becomes 100000 + N.\n\nAccording to the problem, 10N + 1 is three times as large as 100000 + N. So we can write the equation:\n\n10N + 1 = 3(100000 + N)\n\nSolving this equation gives N = 42857. \n\nSo, the number is 42857."
"Let's denote the total number of students as 100% (or simply 100 for easier calculations). \n\nAccording to the problem, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means that there are 24 students who are in both clubs.\n\nThe problem also states that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that these students are only in the swim team and not in the chess club. If we denote the total number of swim team members as x, then 20% of x equals the number of students who are only in the swim team. \n\nWe can set up the equation as follows: \n\n0.20x = number of students in the swim team but not in the chess club.\n\nBut we know that the total number of students in the swim team is the sum of students in both clubs and those only in the swim team. So:\n\nx = 24 (students in both clubs) + 0.20x \n\nSolving this equation for x gives:\n\n0.80x = 24 \n\nx = 24 / 0.80 \n\nx = 30 \n\nSo, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.\n\nAnswer: B) 30%."
'The population of the city increases by 5% annually. This means that each year, the population is multiplied by 1.05 (which is equivalent to 100% + 5%).\n\nSo, after one year, the population will be 78000 * 1.05 = 81900.\n\nAfter two years, the population will be 81900 * 1.05 = 85995.\n\nSo, the population of the city in 2 years time will be 85995.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 85995.'

This means they are effectively closing the distance between them at a combined speed of 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph.\n\nThe total distance to be covered is 50 miles. \n\nTo find out how long it will take for them to meet, we divide the total distance by their combined speed:\n\n50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours\n\nSo, the two cars will meet 2 hours after they begin. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 2.'
"The servant wants his total monthly income to be 6000. He already receives a monthly salary of 1500. Therefore, he needs to earn an additional 6000 - 1500 = 4500 from his commission.\n\nThe commission is 15% of the monthly sale. Therefore, to find out how much sale he needs to make, we need to calculate the amount that would give him a commission of 4500.\n\nLet's denote the amount of sale he needs to make as X. We know that 15% of X is equal to 4500. We can write this as an equation:\n\n0.15 * X = 4500\n\nTo solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\nX = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000\n\nTherefore, the servant needs to make a sale of 30000 Rupees to earn a total monthly income of 6000. So, the correct answer is A)30000."
'The total amount paid back by the man is Rs.31.50 * 12 = Rs.378.\n\nThe interest paid by the man is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.\n\nThe interest rate is calculated as (Interest / Principal) * 100.\n\nSo, the interest rate is (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%.\n\nTherefore, the interest rate is 5%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) 5%.'
"Let's assume the original price of the product is $100. \n\nWhen the price is reduced by 30%, the new price becomes $70 (because 30% of 100 is 30, and 100 - 30 = 70).\n\nTo return the product to its original price of $100, we need to find out what percentage increase $70 needs.\n\nThe difference between the original price and the reduced price is $30 (because 100 - 70 = 30).\n\nTo find out what percentage $30 is of $70, we divide 30 by 70 and multiply by 100 (because the formula for finding the percentage is (part/whole) * 100).\n\nSo, (30/70) * 100 = 42.86%.\n\nTherefore, the price of the product needs to be increased by 42.86% to return it to its original price.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B) 42.86%."
"The total amount in the pouch is Rs. 700, which is equal to 70000 paise.\n\nLet's denote the number of each type of coin as x. \n\nSo, the total amount in the pouch can be represented as the sum of the values of each type of coin:\n\n25x (value of 25 paise coins) + 50x (value of 50 paise coins) + 100x (value of one rupee coins) = 70000\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n175x = 70000\n\nx = 70000 / 175 = 400\n\nSo, there are 400 of each type of coin. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 400."

'The hollow cube of size 5cm is made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm. This means that the hollow cube is made up of 5*5*5 = 125 smaller cubes. \n\nHowever, since the cube is hollow and has a thickness of 1cm, we need to subtract the inner cubes that are not present. The inner cube would be of size 3cm (5cm - 1cm thickness on each side), so it would be made up of 3*3*3 = 27 smaller cubes. \n\nSo, the total number of smaller cubes present in the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.\n\nEach cube has 6 faces. Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, all the outer faces of the smaller cubes are painted. The outer layer of the cube is made up of 5*5*6 = 150 faces. \n\nSo, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 98*6 = 588 faces. \n\nSubtracting the painted faces from the total number of faces, we get 588 - 150 = 438 faces.\n\nSo, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 438.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 438.'

"Let's denote the ages of R, Q, and T as r, q, and t respectively. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means that r - q = q - t. \n\n2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. This means that r + t = 50.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express r and t in terms of q:\n\nr = q + (q - t) and t = q - (r - q).\n\nSubstituting these into the second equation gives:\n\nq + (q - t) + q - (q + (q - t)) = 50\n3q - t = 50\nt = 3q - 50\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives:\n\nq + (q - (3q - 50)) = q\n2q = 50\nq = 25\n\nSubstituting q = 25 into the first equation gives:\n\nr - 25 = 25 - t\nr = 50 - t\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives:\n\n50 - t + t = 50\n50 = 50\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q's age is r - q = 50 - 25 = 25 years. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None of the above."
'First, subtract the initial charge from the total amount of money you have: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00. This is the amount of money you have left to spend on the additional quarter miles.\n\nNext, divide this amount by the cost per additional quarter mile: $5.00 ÷ $0.10 = 50. This is the number of additional quarter miles you can afford.\n\nSince each additional charge is for a quarter mile, multiply this number by a quarter to find out how many miles this represents: 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.\n\nFinally, add the initial quarter mile to this distance: 12.5 miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles.\n\nSo, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

"Amy will need 5 letters to create the codes for all 10 types of books.\n\nHere's why:\n\nFirst, let's consider the single-letter codes. Each letter can represent one type of book, so if Amy uses all 5 letters as single-letter codes, she can represent 5 types of books.\n\nNext, let's consider the two-letter codes. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, each pair of different letters can represent one type of book. With 5 letters, there are 10 possible pairs (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE).\n\nTherefore, with 5 letters, Amy can create 5 single-letter codes and 10 two-letter codes, for a total of 15 unique codes. Since she only needs to represent 10 types of books, 5 letters are enough.\n\nHere's how the codes might look:\n\nSingle-letter codes: A, B, C, D, E\nTwo-letter codes: AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE\n\nSo, the answer is C) 5."
'The area of the rectangle is given by the formula length x breadth = 150 sq m. \n\nWe are also given that the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth. We can express this as length = 4*breadth + 1. \n\nWe can substitute this into the area formula to get: (4*breadth + 1) * breadth = 150. \n\nSolving this equation for breadth, we get breadth = 6m. \n\nSubstituting this back into the length equation, we get length = 4*6 + 1 = 25m. \n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula 2(length + breadth).

'To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we need to consider the vitamin that is less present in the health food, which is vitamin A. \n\nSince 1 gram of the health food contains 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 = 12.5 grams of the health food to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. \n\nThis amount will also provide more than the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, since 1 gram of the health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 12.5 grams.'
"To find out how many helpers are needed, we first need to determine how many cakes can be made in the given time.\n\nFor the large cakes: \n20 large cakes are needed. Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 2*3 = 6 large cakes. \nTherefore, to make 20 large cakes, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to 4 helpers.\n\nFor the small cakes: \n700 small cakes are needed. Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 35*3 = 105 small cakes. \nTherefore, to make 700 small cakes, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Again, since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to 7 helpers.\n\nSo, in total, we need 4 helpers for the large cakes and 7 helpers for the small cakes, which adds up to 4+7 = 11 helpers.\n\nHowever, the options do not include 11. This suggests that the helpers cannot switch between making large and small cakes within the 3 hours. In this case, we would need 10 helpers for the large cakes (as 2 cakes per hour for 3 hours is 6 cakes per helper, and 20 cakes divided by 6 is approximately 3.33, rounded up to 4) and 20 helpers for the small cakes (as 35 cakes per hour for 3 hours is 105 cakes per helper, and 700 cakes divided by 105 is approximately 6.67, rounded up to 7). This would give a total of 4 + 7 = 11 helpers.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options. There seems to be a mistake in the problem."

Substituting the given values, we get 5 + 11 = 16. \n\nBut we need to find RU, which is RT - TU = 17 - 11 = 6. \n\nSo, the length of line segment RU is 6. \n\nThe answer is A) 6."
"Let's denote the amount of falafel in one pita bread as P, in one roll as R, and in one baguette as B. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that 6P = 2R, or equivalently, R = 3P. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that 3R = 5B, or equivalently, B = 3/5 * R. \n\nSubstituting R = 3P into the equation for B, we get B = 3/5 * 3P = 9/5P. \n\nThe question asks for the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, or in other words, we need to solve the equation 2B = xP for x. \n\nSubstituting B = 9/5P into this equation, we get 2 * 9/5P = xP, or equivalently, x = 18/5 = 3.6. \n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a pita bread, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 4. \n\nTherefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as approximately 4 pita breads. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the problem or in the answer choices."
'The shopkeeper has given a discount of 20% on all items for one day. This means that the items are now being sold at 80% of their original price (100% - 20% = 80%).\n\nThe next day, he needs to return the prices to their original amount. To find out by what percentage he needs to increase the price, we need to find out what percentage 80% is of 100%.\n\nTo do this, we divide 100% by 80% and get 1.25. This means that to return to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25%.\n\nSo, the answer is C) 25%.'
"Let's denote the train fare for one person as T. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare, so we can denote the bus fare for one person as (4/3)*T/2 = 2T/3.\n\nThe total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6*(2T/3) = 4T. The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8*T.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of these two amounts is Rs.1512, so we can write the equation:\n\n4T + 8T = 1512\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n12T = 1512\n\nT = 1512 / 12 = 126\n\nSo, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.126. The correct answer is A)126."
'The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + width). Given that the length of the rectangle is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters, we can substitute these values into the formula.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2(8cm + 3cm) = 2(11cm) = 22cm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 22cm.'
'The number of ways to arrange the 6 books is given by the formula for permutations, which is n!. In this case, n is 6, so the number of arrangements is 6!.\n\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 different ways to arrange the 6 books on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)720.'
'The total width of the pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.\n\nThe total space between the pickets is (x - 1) * 6 inches. We subtract 1 from x because there is no space after the last picket.\n\nSo, the total length of the fence in inches is x/2 + (x - 1) * 6 = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 13x/2 - 6.\n\nSince 1 foot equals 12 inches, we need to divide the length in inches by 12 to convert it to feet.\n\nSo, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) (13x - 12) / 24.'
"Let's denote the speed of the ship as s (in miles per hour), and the speed of the plane as 10s (since it's 10 times faster). \n\nThe ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane started. Therefore, the time it took for the ship to travel this distance is 180/s hours. \n\nWhen the plane starts, both the ship and the plane are moving towards each other. The ship is still moving at speed s, and the plane is moving at speed 10s. \n\nSince they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is s + 10s = 11s. \n\nThe time it takes for them to meet is the same for both the ship and the plane, because they meet at the same time. Let's denote this time as t. \n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nFor the ship, the total distance it travels is the 180 miles it has already traveled plus the distance it travels while it's moving towards the plane. This can be represented as:\n\n180 + s*t \n\nFor the plane, the total distance it travels is just the distance it travels while it's moving towards the ship, which can be represented as:\n\n10s*t \n\nSince the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane is the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n180 + s*t = 10s*t \n\nSolving for t gives:\n\nt = 180 / 9s \n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the distance traveled by the plane gives:\n\nDistance = 10s * (180 / 9s) = 200 miles \n\nTherefore, the ship and the plane meet 200 miles from the starting point. \n\nSo, the answer is C) 200."
'The key to this problem is understanding that the proportion of tagged deer in the sample caught in 2002 is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.\n\nIn 2002, 20 out of 500 deer caught were tagged. This is a proportion of 20/500 = 0.04 or 4%.\n\nThis means that in the entire population, approximately 4% of the deer are tagged. We know from the problem that 300 deer were tagged in 2001.\n\nSo, if 300 deer represent 4% of the total population, we can find the total population by dividing 300 by 0.04.\n\n300 ÷ 0.04 = 7500\n\nSo, the total deer population in the forest is approximately 7500.\n\nAnswer: E) 7500.'
'The man can catch the first train that comes in two scenarios: either the main line train arrives first, or the harbor line train arrives first. \n\nThe main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 AM, so it arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on. The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 AM, so it arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.\n\nIn the first 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10), the man can only catch the main line train because the harbor line train arrives at 5:02 and the next main line train arrives at 5:10. So, in the first 10 minutes, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 1.\n\nIn the next 10 minutes (from 5:10 to 5:20), the man can catch either the main line train at 5:10 or the harbor line train at 5:12. The probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 2/10 = 0.2 because the main line train arrives 2 minutes before the harbor line train.\n\nIn the next 10 minutes (from 5:20 to 5:30), the man can catch either the main line train at 5:20 or the harbor line train at 5:22. Again, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 2/10 = 0.2.\n\nThis pattern continues for every 10-minute interval. Therefore, the overall probability of the man catching the first train that comes is the average of the probabilities in each 10-minute interval, which is (1 + 0.2 + 0.2 + ...) / number of intervals. Since the number of intervals is infinite, the overall probability is the limit of this sequence as the number of intervals goes to infinity, which is 0.2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B) 0.2.'
'The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.\n\nThe average weight of the 11 vehicles, including the new truck, is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.\n\nSo, the total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\nSo, the answer is A) 40.8.'
"Let's denote the population one year ago as P. \n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago, so it would be 2P. \n\nThe population is projected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, if we denote the current population as C, the population two years from now would be C * 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21C. \n\nSince 1.21C = 2P, we can say that C = 2P/1.21 = 1.65P approximately. \n\nThis means that the population has increased from P to 1.65P over the last year. \n\nTo find the percent increase, we subtract the original number (P) from the new number (1.65P) and then divide by the original number (P), and multiply by 100%:\n\n((1.65P - P) / P) * 100% = 0.65 * 100% = 65%\n\nSo, the population has increased by approximately 65% over the last year. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 65%."
"Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S.\n\nFrom the first condition, we know that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be written as:\n\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nFrom the second condition, we know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This can be written as:\n\nA + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations that we can solve. \n\nFirst, let's simplify the equations:\n\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nA + 10 = 3S - 30\n\nThen, rearrange the equations:\n\n2A - S = 90\n3S - A = 40\n\nMultiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:\n\n6A - 3S = 270\n6S - 2A = 80\n\nAdd these two equations together:\n\n6A - 3S + 6S - 2A = 270 + 80\n4A + 3S = 350\n\nDivide the whole equation by 4:\n\nA + 0.75S = 87.5\n\nSubstitute A from the second equation (A = 3S - 40) into this equation:\n\n3S - 40 + 0.75S = 87.5\n3.75S = 127.5\nS = 127.5 / 3.75\nS = 34\n\nSubstitute S = 34 into the second equation:\n\nA = 3*34 - 40\nA = 102 - 40\nA = 62\n\nSo, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. The answer is B) 62, 34."
"The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, we know that one side (the width) is 100 feet and the total area is 3,000 square feet. \n\nTo find the length of the other side, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for length:\n\nLength = Area / Width\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nLength = 3,000 square feet / 100 feet = 30 feet\n\nSo, the length of the other side of Julie's yard is 30 feet. The correct answer is A) 30 feet."
'The product of the GCF and the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers. This means that 11 (the GCF) times 7700 (the LCM) is equal to 350 (one of the numbers) times the other number. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n\n11 * 7700 = 350 * x \n\nThen, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 350:\n\n(11 * 7700) / 350 = x \n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n242 = x \n\nSo, the other number is 242. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 242.'
'The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2*70 = 140 square feet.\n\nThe rectangle was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of a square. Therefore, if we let x be the side length of the square, then the length of the rectangle is x and the width of the rectangle is x - 4.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is length times width, so we can set up the equation x*(x - 4) = 140 to find the side length of the square.\n\nSolving this equation gives x = 14. Therefore, the side length of the square is 14 feet.\n\nThe perimeter of a square is four times the length of one side, so the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4*14 = 56 feet.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 56.'
'The ratio 5:3 means that the length of the ribbon was reduced from 5 parts to 3 parts. \n\nTo find out the new length, we first need to determine the size of each part. We do this by dividing the original length by the first number in the ratio. \n\nSo, each part is 30 cm / 5 = 6 cm. \n\nSince the ribbon was reduced to 3 parts, the new length is 3 parts * 6 cm/part = 18 cm. \n\nSo, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A)18.'
"First, let's understand the given equation M - N + 396c = 990. \n\nSince M = abc and N = cba, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n99a - 99c + 396c = 990\n\nFurther simplifying, we get:\n\n99a + 297c = 990\n\nDividing the entire equation by 99, we get:\n\na + 3c = 10\n\nThis means that a = 10 - 3c. \n\nSince a, b, and c are digits, they can only take values from 0 to 9. Also, since M > N and M = abc, a cannot be 0. \n\nSo, the possible values for c are 0, 1, 2, 3. \n\nFor c = 0, a = 10 - 3*0 = 10, which is not possible as a is a digit and can only take values from 1 to 9.\n\nFor c = 1, a = 10 - 3*1 = 7. So, one possible value for M is 710.\n\nFor c = 2, a = 10 - 3*2 = 4. So, another possible value for M is 420.\n\nFor c = 3, a = 10 - 3*3 = 1. So, the third possible value for M is 130.\n\nHowever, M must be greater than 300. So, only two values of M (710 and 420) are more than 300.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None. The number of values of M that are more than 300 is 2, which is not among the given options."
"The least possible number of students in the school would be when the number of students is such that both 20% and 28% of the total students give a whole number. \n\nLet's denote the total number of students as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, 0.20x and 0.28x must be whole numbers. \n\nThe smallest number that both 20 and 28 can divide evenly is their least common multiple (LCM). \n\nThe LCM of 20 and 28 is 140. \n\nTherefore, the total number of students must be a multiple of 140. \n\nThe smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501 is 560. \n\nSo, the least possible number of students in the school is 560. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) none of these."
'Raj is currently 17 years old. This means that 5 years ago, Raj was 17 - 5 = 12 years old. \n\nAccording to the problem, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago.

'The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope, which means it can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet. The area of a circle is given by the formula πr². Substituting the given radius into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = π * (14)² = 616 square feet (approximately)\n\nThis is the total area the cow can graze.\n\nThe cow grazes 10 square feet per day. Therefore, to find out how long it will take for the cow to graze the entire field, we divide the total area by the area grazed per day:\n\nTime = Total area / Area grazed per day = 616 / 10 = 61.6 days\n\nSince the cow cannot graze for a fraction of a day, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 62 days. However, since this option is not available in the answer choices, the closest available option is 61 days.\n\nSo, the cow will take approximately 61 days to graze the whole field. The correct answer is (B) 61 days.'
'The book was initially sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the cost price of the book is Rs 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25.\n\nIf the book was sold for Rs 25.75 instead, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage as follows:\n\nProfit or Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price\n= Rs 25.75 - Rs 25\n= Rs 0.75\n\nProfit or Loss Percentage = (Profit or Loss / Cost Price) * 100\n= (Rs 0.75 / Rs 25) * 100\n= 3%\n\nSince the selling price is higher than the cost price, this is a profit. Therefore, if the book was sold for Rs 25.75, there would have been a profit of 3%.\n\nSo, the answer is B) 3% Profit.'

"Let's denote the fixed part of the bill as F and the variable part as V. We know that the total bill is the sum of the fixed part and the variable part, which depends on the number of calls. So, we can write two equations based on the information given:\n\n1) F + 540V = 1800\n2) F + 620V = 2040\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n80V = 240\n\nSolving for V, we find that V = 240/80 = Rs.3 per call.\n\nSubstituting V = 3 into the first equation, we get:\n\nF + 540*3 = 1800\n\nSolving for F, we find that F = 1800 - 1620 = Rs.180.\n\nSo, the fixed part of the bill is Rs.180 and the variable part is Rs.3 per call.\n\nFor a month in which 500 calls are made, the bill would be:\n\nF + 500V = 180 + 500*3 = Rs.1680.\n\nSo, the answer is B) Rs.1680."
'First, we need to find out how long it takes for each ball to make one full rotation. \n\nFor ball A, it makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to make one full rotation.\n\nFor ball B, it makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to make one full rotation.\n\nNext, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7, which is the time when both balls will be at the same starting point again. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the balls will be at the same starting point again in 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes. \n\nSo, the answer is A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.'
"The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is determined by the smaller of the two categories. In this case, there are 20 fiction books and 30 hardcover books. Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both is 20, because once all the fiction books are also hardcover, there can't be any more books that are both (since there are no more fiction books left). \n\nSo, the answer is D) 20."
"Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (or any other day except Sunday) as x. According to the problem, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.\n\nThe total cost of newspapers on Sunday is 2x * $4 = $8x.\nThe total cost of newspapers on the rest of the week is 6x * $1 = $6x.\n\nThe total cost of newspapers per week is $8x + $6x = $14x.\n\nAccording to the problem, this total cost is $210. So we have the equation:\n\n$14x = $210.\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:\n\nx = $210 / 14 = 15.\n\nSo, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. The answer is A)15."
"Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic as x. Therefore, the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is x - 4.\n\nAccording to the problem, each friend was supposed to contribute 96/x rupees. However, due to the absence of 4 friends, each of the remaining friends had to contribute 96/(x - 4) rupees.\n\nThe difference between these two amounts is 4 rupees, which gives us the equation:\n\n96/(x - 4) - 96/x = 4\n\nTo solve this equation, we first multiply all terms by x(x - 4) to get rid of the denominators:\n\n96x - 96(x - 4) = 4x(x - 4)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n96x - 96x + 384 = 4x^2 - 16x\n\nRearranging terms gives us the quadratic equation:\n\n4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0\n\nDividing all terms by 4 simplifies this to:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored to:\n\n(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0\n\nThe solutions to this equation are x = 12 and x = -8. Since the number of friends cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -8.\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic is 12. Subtracting the 4 friends who did not attend, we find that the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nSo, the answer is A) 8."

"Let's denote the amount of money each nephew receives as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x. \n\nSimilarly, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x. \n\nThe total amount of money is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, so we can write the equation:\n\n5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n25x + 16x + 2x = 8600\n\n43x = 8600\n\nx = 8600 / 43\n\nx = 200\n\nSo, each nephew receives Rs 200. \n\nSince each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, each daughter receives 4 * 200 = Rs 800.\n\nSo, the answer is E) Rs 800."
"Let's denote Meenu's weight as x. According to her statement, her weight is 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. This can be written as an equation:\n\nx = 29 + 0.5x\n\nTo solve for x, we first subtract 0.5x from both sides of the equation:\n\nx - 0.5x = 29\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0.5x = 29\n\nThen, to solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.5:\n\nx = 29 / 0.5\n\nx = 58\n\nSo, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. Therefore, the correct answer is D) 58."
"The answer is A) 45 Min.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen Roy takes the first tablet, he doesn't have to wait. So, no time is spent for the first tablet. \n\nThen, he waits 15 minutes to take the second tablet, another 15 minutes for the third tablet, another 15 minutes for the fourth tablet, and another 15 minutes for the fifth tablet.\n\nSo, the total time spent is 15 minutes (for the second tablet) + 15 minutes (for the third tablet) + 15 minutes (for the fourth tablet) + 15 minutes (for the fifth tablet) = 60 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect because the time starts after he takes the first tablet. So, the correct calculation should be:\n\n0 minutes (for the first tablet) + 15 minutes (for the second tablet) + 15 minutes (for the third tablet) + 15 minutes (for the fourth tablet) + 15 minutes (for the fifth tablet) = 60 minutes.\n\nBut, the last 15 minutes is not needed because he doesn't have to wait after taking the last tablet. So, the total time spent is 60 minutes - 15 minutes = 45 minutes.\n\nSo, it will take Roy 45 minutes to consume all the 5 tablets."
"The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets. \n\nGiven that there are 120 green sweets, we can find out how many red sweets there are by setting up a proportion. \n\nLet's denote the number of red sweets as R. \n\nSo, we have the proportion: \n\n4/3 = 120/R \n\nTo solve for R, we can cross-multiply: \n\n4R = 360 \n\nThen, divide both sides by 4: \n\nR = 90 \n\nSo, there are 90 red sweets. \n\nThe answer is A)90."
"The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P) with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.\n\nLet's denote the number of members as n. The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS = n/2 * (a + l)\n\nwhere S is the sum of the progression, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nWe know that S = 250 and a = 7. We don't know l, but we can express it in terms of a, n, and the common difference d:\n\nl = a + (n - 1) * d\n\nSubstituting this into the sum formula gives:\n\n250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n - 1) * 0.25)\n\nSolving this equation for n gives:\n\nn = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 members in the club. The correct answer is B) 20."
'The total cost of the gift is Rs. D. Initially, M men agreed to contribute towards the purchase of the gift. So, the cost per person initially is D/M.\n\nWhen 3 men drop out, the remaining men are M-3. So, the new cost per person is D/(M-3).\n\nThe increase in contribution per person is the new cost per person minus the initial cost per person. \n\nSo, the increase in contribution per person is D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nTo simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator of M and (M-3) is M*(M-3). \n\nSo, the increase in contribution per person is [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)].\n\nSimplify the numerator: DM - D*M + 3D = 3D.\n\nSo, the increase in contribution per person is 3D / [M*(M-3)].\n\nThis simplifies to 3D/(M^2-3M).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) 3D/(M^2-3M). \n\nThis means that each of the remaining men will have to contribute an additional amount of 3D/(M^2-3M) towards the purchase of the gift.'
'Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200. So, the selling price (after discount) should be 120% of Rs. 1200.\n\n120% of Rs. 1200 = 120/100 * 1200 = Rs. 1440\n\nThis is the price after a 20% discount. So, the original price (before discount) should be 100% + 20% = 120% of the selling price.\n\n120% of Rs. 1440 = 120/100 * 1440 = Rs. 1728\n\nBut this is not the correct answer because we have calculated the wrong way. The selling price is 80% (100% - 20% discount) of the marked price, not 120%. So, we should have:\n\n1440 = 80/100 * Marked Price\n\nSolving for Marked Price gives:\n\nMarked Price = 1440 * 100/80 = Rs. 1800\n\nSo, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)1,800.'
'Train A has a head start of 3 hours (from 11 am to 2 pm) before Train B starts. In these 3 hours, Train A would have covered a distance of 3 hours * 40 kmph = 120 km.\n\nNow, the relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph (since they are moving in the same direction).\n\nThe time it would take for Train B to cover the 120 km head start of Train A is Distance/Speed = 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours.\n\nSo, Train B will catch up with Train A 3.75 hours after 2 pm, which is at 5:45 pm on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the two trains will meet each other at 5:45 pm on the same day. So, the answer is E) None of these.'
"Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as M and the amount of money John has as J.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can write the equation: M + J/2 = 75.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can write the equation: J + M/3 = 75.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of M and J.\n\nFirst, multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of M the same in both equations: 2J + 2M/3 = 150.\n\nThen, subtract the first equation from the new second equation: 2J + 2M/3 - M - J/2 = 150 - 75.\n\nThis simplifies to: 3J/2 + M/6 = 75.\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 6 to get rid of the fractions: 9J + M = 450.\n\nSubstitute M from the first equation (M = 75 - J/2) into this equation: 9J + 75 - J/2 = 450.\n\nThis simplifies to: 18J + 150 - J = 900.\n\nSolving for J gives: J = 900 - 150 / 17 = 750 / 17 = 44.12.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.

'Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can say that the number of lilies on the lake is a power of 2. \n\nIf it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered starting from one lily, then the number of lilies on the lake on the 60th day is $2^{60/2} = 2^{30}$.\n\nIf initially there were 64 lilies on the lake, then this is $2^6$ lilies. \n\nTo find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered starting from 64 lilies, we need to find out how many doublings it takes to get from $2^6$ to $2^{30}$. \n\nThis is simply $30 - 6 = 24$ doublings. \n\nSince the number of lilies doubles every two days, it will take $24 * 2 = 48$ days for the lake to be fully covered starting from 64 lilies. \n\nHowever, the 64 lilies were already there on the first day, so we need to add one day to get the total time. \n\nSo, it will take $48 + 1 = 49$ days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. \n\nHowever, this answer is not in the options. There might be a mistake in the problem or the options. The closest option to 49 is 53, so if we had to choose, we would go with option D) 53.'
"The rate of work done by x men working x hours per day is x units of work in x days. This means that the rate of work is x units of work per man per hour per day.\n\nSo, the rate of work done by y men working y hours per day for y days would be y times the rate of work done by x men working x hours per day for x days.\n\nLet's denote the rate of work done by x men working x hours per day as R. So, R = x units of work per man per hour per day.\n\nThen, the rate of work done by y men working y hours per day for y days would be y * R = y * x units of work per man per hour per day.\n\nSince the rate of work is directly proportional to the number of men, the number of hours worked per day, and the number of days, we can write the equation as:\n\ny * x = y * y * y * y\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = y^3\n\nSo, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is y^3 units of work.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) y^3/x^2 units."

"Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation. This includes those who take both a winter and a summer vacation.\n2. 40% of employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.\n3. 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.\n\nFirst, let's find out the percentage of employees who take at least one vacation. Since 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, that means 80% of employees take at least one vacation.\n\nWe know that 40% of employees take both vacations, and this is included in the 75% who take a winter vacation. So, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75% - 40% = 35%.\n\nSince we know that 80% of employees take at least one vacation, and we've already accounted for 35% who take only a winter vacation and 40% who take both vacations, the remaining percentage must be those who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.\n\nSo, Q% = 80% - 35% - 40% = 5%.\n\nTherefore, 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. The answer is (A) 5%."

"First, let's find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy.\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means that for every 15 parts (6+9) of the alloy, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15)*40 = 24 grams of copper.\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means that for every 18 parts (7+11) of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper.\n\nNow, let's combine the two alloys to form alloy Z. The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 grams (from alloy X) + 23.33 grams (from alloy Y) = 39.33 grams. The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 grams (from alloy X) + 36.67 grams (from alloy Y) = 60.67 grams.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is approximately 0.67. This gives us a ratio of approximately 59:91.\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91. The answer is (B) 59:91."

'First, we need to find out how many voters are eligible to vote. \n\nGiven that 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible to vote, we can calculate the number of eligible voters as follows:\n\n5,000 voters * 20% = 1,000 voters are not eligible to vote.\n\nSo, the number of eligible voters = Total voters - Not eligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 voters.\n\nThe winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. This means that the total votes were divided into two parts: 50% + 15% = 65% for the winning candidate and 50% - 15% = 35% for the losing candidate.\n\nSo, the number of votes the winning candidate got = 65% of total eligible voters = 65/100 * 4,000 = 2,600 votes.\n\nTherefore, the winning candidate got 2,600 votes.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this result. There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.'
'To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to maximize the number of brass coins because they are worth more. \n\n$3.40 is equal to 340 cents. \n\nIf we divide 340 by 25 (the value of each brass coin), we get 13 remainder 15. This means she could have brought up 13 brass coins and still have 15 cents left. \n\n15 cents is less than the value of a brass coin but is equal to the value of a copper coin. \n\nSo, the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up is 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 1.'
"The total distance between points A and B can be found by adding the distances covered by Ram and Krishna in the given time.\n\nRam's speed is 20m/s and he travels for 10 seconds, so the distance covered by Ram is 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters.\n\nKrishna's speed is 40m/s and he also travels for 10 seconds, so the distance covered by Krishna is 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters.\n\nTherefore, the total distance between points A and B is 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E) 600 meters."
"The speed of car 'X' is calculated by dividing the distance covered (320 kms) by the time taken (8 hours). So, the speed of car 'X' is 320/8 = 40 kms/hr.\n\nSimilarly, the speed of car 'Y' is calculated by dividing the distance covered (415 kms) by the time taken (5 hours). So, the speed of car 'Y' is 415/5 = 83 kms/hr.\n\nThe difference in speed is calculated by subtracting the speed of car 'X' from the speed of car 'Y'. So, the difference in speed is 83 - 40 = 43 kms/hr.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the speed of the two cars is 43 kms/hr. So, the correct answer is C) 43 kms/hr."
"Let's denote the distance from Winson's home to his school as D (in miles). \n\nWhen Winson runs from home to school, the time he spends is D/10 (in hours), because time = distance/speed. \n\nWhen he walks back home, the time he spends is D/5 (in hours), because time = distance/speed. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total time for the journey is 1 hour. So we can set up the equation: \n\nD/10 + D/5 = 1 \n\nMultiply all terms by 10 to get rid of the fractions: \n\nD + 2D = 10 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n3D = 10 \n\nDivide both sides by 3: \n\nD = 10/3 \n\nSo, the distance from Winson's home to his school is 10/3 miles, which is approximately 3.33 miles. \n\nHowever, since the answer choices are all integers, we can round 3.33 to the nearest whole number, which is 3. \n\nSo, the answer is D) 3."
'The store sold 80% of its inventory of 600 golf balls, which is 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls.\n\nSince the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, this means it sold 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls.\n\nSince all of the white golf balls were sold, this means the store had 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.\n\nTherefore, the store had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 360.'
'The height of the flagstaff and the length of its shadow form a ratio.

'The answer is D) 6.\n\nExplanation: \nSince there are 5 different colours of ties, if you take one tie of each colour, you would have 5 ties. However, none of these ties would be the same colour because you have taken one of each colour. To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same colour, you would need to take one more tie. This sixth tie would have to be the same colour as one of the ties you have already taken because there are only 5 different colours. Therefore, you would need to take 6 ties to ensure you have at least two ties of the same colour.'

'The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. He then sold the oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. This means the total selling price of the oranges was 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675.\n\nThe gain made by the merchant is the selling price minus the cost price. In this case, the gain is Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225.\n\nThe percentage gain is calculated by dividing the gain by the cost price and then multiplying by 100. In this case, the percentage gain is (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 50%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage gain of the merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg is 50%. So, the correct answer is A) 50 %.'

'Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters.\n\nThe area of the walls of the room = 2x * 5x = 10x^2 sq.m.\n\nGiven that an area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, the area to be papered = 10x^2 - 15 sq.m.\n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs.260 and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. Since the width of the paper used is 50cm or 0.5m, the length of the paper used = 260/2 = 130m.\n\nThe area of the paper used = length * width = 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.\n\nTherefore, 10x^2 - 15 = 65.\n\nSolving this equation gives x^2 = 8.\n\nSo, the height of the room = 2x = 2*sqrt(8) = 2*2.83 = 5.66m.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. There seems to be a mistake in the problem. The correct answer should be 5.66m.'
"The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. In this case, the first term is -50 and the sum is 51, so we can use this information to solve for k (the number of terms).\n\nLet's denote the last term of the sequence as a. Then, according to the formula, we have:\n\n51 = k/2 * (-50 + a)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n102 = k * (-50 + a)\n\nWe know that a = -50 + k - 1 (since the numbers are consecutive), so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n102 = k * (-50 + -50 + k - 1)\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n102 = k * (k - 101)\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives us two solutions: k = 0 or k = 101. However, k cannot be zero because we are told that there are k consecutive integers. Therefore, the only possible value for k is 101.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 102."

"Let's denote the original price of each article as x. After the price decrease, the price of each article is 85% of the original price, or 0.85x. \n\nAccording to the problem, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the total cost of 5 articles at the new price is equal to $300. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n\n5 * 0.85x = 300 \n\nSolving this equation for x gives us the original price of each article. \n\n0.85x = 300 / 5 \n\n0.85x = 60 \n\nx = 60 / 0.85 \n\nx = $70.59 (approximately)\n\nSo, the original price of each article was approximately $70.59. \n\nThe new price of each article, after the 15% decrease, is 85% of this original price. \n\nNew price = 0.85 * $70.59 = $59.99 (approximately)\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices.

"Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on Heads as H and the number of times it landed on Tails as T. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n1) H + T = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times)\n\n2) 2H = 3T (since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money, the amount of money exchanged must be equal)\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and T. \n\nSubstitute H = 20 - T into the second equation:\n\n2(20 - T) = 3T\n40 - 2T = 3T\n40 = 5T\nT = 8\n\nSubstitute T = 8 into the first equation:\n\nH + 8 = 20\nH = 12\n\nSo, the coin landed on Heads 12 times. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 12."
"Let's denote the distance between X and Y as D. \n\nWhen Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have collectively covered the distance D. Since they are moving at different speeds, we can calculate the distance each of them covered using the formula: \n\nDistance = Speed * Time \n\nSince they have been traveling for the same amount of time, we can set up the equation as follows: \n\n54T + 78T = D \n\nWhere T is the time they have been traveling. Simplifying this equation gives us: \n\n132T = D \n\nAfter their first meeting, they continue traveling until they meet again. At this point, they have collectively covered the distance 3D (since they have each traveled the distance D once, and then met halfway). \n\nAgain, we can set up the equation as follows: \n\n54T' + 78T' = 3D \n\nWhere T' is the total time they have been traveling. \n\nHowever, we know that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. This gives us another equation: \n\n78T' - 54T' = 48 \n\nSolving this equation gives us: \n\n24T' = 48 \n\nT' = 2 hours \n\nSubstituting T' into the equation 54T' + 78T' = 3D gives us: \n\n108 + 156 = 3D \n\n264 = 3D \n\nD = 88 km \n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is 88 km. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices."
'The average cost per year of the new tires is $180/4 = $45.\nThe cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40.\n\nTo find the percentage difference, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number, divide by the smaller number, and then multiply by 100%.\n\nSo, the percentage difference is (($45 - $40)/$40) * 100% = 12.5%.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The answer is C) 12.5%.'
"Let's denote the length of the longer piece as x. Therefore, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3. According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20 meters. So we can write the equation:\n\nx + (x - 3) = 20\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n2x - 3 = 20\n2x = 23\nx = 23 / 2\nx = 11.5\n\nSo, the length of the longer piece is 11.5 meters. The answer is D) 11.5."
"The bond's principal amount is $5,000 and the annual interest rate is 12%. However, since the interest is compounded every six months, we need to divide the annual interest rate by 2 to get the semi-annual interest rate. So, the semi-annual interest rate is 12%/2 = 6%.\n\nFor the first six months, the interest accrued is $5,000 * 6% = $300.\n\nAfter six months, the new principal amount becomes $5,000 + $300 = $5,300.\n\nFor the next six months, the interest accrued is $5,300 * 6% = $318.\n\nSo, the total interest accrued at maturity is $300 + $318 = $618.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) $618."
'From the hints, we know that E = 1 and M = 9. So, the multiplication table becomes:\n\n9 A D\nB 1\n-------------\n9 A D\nR A 1\n-------------\nA 9 I D\n\nSince the product of 9AD * 1 is 9AD, we know that B must be 1. But E is already 1, and each letter represents a unique digit, so B cannot be 1. Therefore, B must be 2. The multiplication table now becomes:\n\n9 A D\n2 1\n-------------\n9 A D\nR A 1\n-------------\nA 9 I D\n\nNow, we know that 9AD * 2 = RAE. Since M = 9 and B = 2, R must be 1. So, the multiplication table becomes:\n\n9 A D\n2 1\n-------------\n9 A D\n1 A 1\n-------------\nA 9 I D\n\nNow, we know that 9AD + 1A1 = A9ID. Since M = 9, A must be 2. So, the multiplication table becomes:\n\n9 2 D\n2 1\n-------------\n9 2 D\n1 2 1\n-------------\n2 9 I D\n\nNow, we know that 921 * 2 = 1842 and 921 + 121 = 1042. So, I = 0 and D = 0. Therefore, the multiplication table becomes:\n\n9 2 0\n2 1\n-------------\n9 2 0\n1 2 1\n-------------\n2 9 0 0\n\nSo, the numerical representation of the multiplication table is 920 * 21 = 2900.

'Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, which means Sachin is currently 30 years old. \n\n10 years ago, Sachin was 20 years old. Since Sachin was twice as old as Ajay at that time, this means Ajay was 10 years old 10 years ago.\n\nTherefore, Ajay is currently 10 years + 10 years = 20 years old.\n\nSo, the answer is D) 20.'
'The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + breadth). Given that the perimeter is 340 metres, we can say that length + breadth = 170 metres.\n\nThe area of the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot can be calculated by subtracting the area of the original plot from the area of the larger plot (including the boundary). \n\nThe area of the original plot is length*breadth. The area of the larger plot (including the boundary) is (length+2)*(breadth+2) because the boundary adds 1 metre to each side of the plot.\n\nSo, the area of the boundary is (length+2)*(breadth+2) - length*breadth.\n\nSubstituting length + breadth = 170 into the above equation, we get:\n\nArea of boundary = (170+2)^2 - 170^2 = 4*172 = 688 square metres.\n\nThe cost of gardening is 10 per square metre, so the total cost is 688*10 = 6880.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. The problem may be that we assumed that the length and breadth are equal (which is not stated in the problem). Without knowing the exact dimensions of the plot, we cannot accurately calculate the area of the boundary. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.'
"Let's assume the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company is $100. \n\nAccording to the problem, 34 percent of the total sales revenue came from the sale of novels. So, the revenue from the sale of novels is 34% of $100 = $34.\n\nThe remaining revenue is $100 - $34 = $66.\n\nOf this remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. So, the revenue from the sale of biographies is 1/3 of $66 = $22.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the company's revenue from the sale of novels to its revenue from the sale of biographies. \n\nSo, the ratio is $34 : $22 = 1.545...\n\nTherefore, the company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times its revenue from the sale of biographies.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 1.5."

'The rate at which A can construct a wall is 1 wall per 40 minutes, or 1/40 walls per minute. Similarly, the rate at which B can construct a wall is 1 wall per 45 minutes, or 1/45 walls per minute.\n\nWhen A and B work together, their rates of work are added together. Therefore, the rate at which they can construct a wall together is 1/40 + 1/45 walls per minute.\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to construct a wall together, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate. Therefore, the time it takes is 1 / (1/40 + 1/45) minutes.\n\nThis simplifies to 1 / (45/1800 + 40/1800) = 1 / (85/1800) = 1800/85 = 21.18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it takes approximately 21 minutes for A and B to construct a wall together. The closest answer choice is D) 21 min.'
'The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour. To convert this speed into miles per second, we divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour). \n\n120 miles/hour ÷ 3600 seconds/hour = 0.0333 miles/second\n\nThis means the train travels 0.0333 miles every second.\n\nThe tunnel is 1 mile long. To find out how long it takes the train to travel 1 mile at this speed, we divide the distance by the speed:\n\n1 mile ÷ 0.0333 miles/second = 30 seconds\n\nHowever, this is just the time it takes for the front of the train to reach the end of the tunnel. The train takes an additional 3 seconds to fully enter the tunnel (as given in the problem). \n\nSo, the total time it takes for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is 30 seconds + 3 seconds = 33 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 33 seconds.'
'The merchant can take advantage of a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days. This means he would pay $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200.\n\nIf the merchant borrows $19,200 and pays it back in 30 days, the interest he pays should be less than the discount he receives, which is $800.\n\nThe simple interest formula is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (the amount borrowed), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period. Here, we need to find the highest rate R such that the interest I is less than $800.\n\nSo, we have $800 = $19,200 * R * (30/365). Solving for R gives us R = $800 / ($19,200 * (30/365)) = 0.6137, or 61.37%.\n\nHowever, this is the annual interest rate. The question asks for the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount. This would be the daily interest rate, which we can find by dividing the annual rate by 365.\n\nSo, the highest daily interest rate the merchant can afford is 61.37% / 365 = 0.168%, or 0.00168 as a decimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None of these. The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 0.168% per day.'
'The problem can be solved using the concept of combinations in mathematics. \n\nA combination is a selection of items without considering the order. In this case, we are selecting 5 bottles out of 10 to give to the first group of customers.

"Let's denote the cost of one soda as S and the cost of one energy bar as B. \n\nFrom the given information, we can form two equations:\n\n1) S + 2B = 150 (one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents)\n2) 2S + 3B = 300 (two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents)\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 4B = 300. \n\nSubtracting the second equation from this gives B = 0. This means that the energy bars are free.\n\nSubstituting B = 0 into the first equation gives S = 150. So, one soda costs 150 cents.\n\nTherefore, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 cents.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 900."
'The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total selling price of the pens is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72000.\n\nThe company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. So, the cost price of the pens is 100% - 25% = 75% of the selling price.\n\nTherefore, the cost price of the pens is 75/100 * 72000 = Rs. 54000.\n\nHowever, we know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. So, the cost price calculated above is for 90% of the pens.\n\nTherefore, the cost price for 100% of the pens (including the defective ones) is 54000 / 90 * 100 = Rs. 60000.\n\nSo, the manufactured cost of each pen, including the defective ones, is 60000 / (7200 / 90 * 100) = Rs. 7.2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Rs. 7.2.'
"Let's denote the digit at the ten's place as x and the digit at the unit's place as y. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that y = 2x. \n\nWe also know that the two-digit number is 10x + y, and it exceeds the sum of its digits (x + y) by 18. So we can write the equation: \n\n10x + y = x + y + 18 \n\nSolving this equation gives us 9x = 18, so x = 2. \n\nSubstituting x = 2 into the equation y = 2x gives us y = 4. \n\nSo the two-digit number is 24, which is answer choice B. \n\nWe can check our answer: \n\n- The sum of the digits of 24 is 2 + 4 = 6. \n- 24 does indeed exceed 6 by 18. \n- The digit at the unit's place (4) is double the digit in the ten's place (2). \n\nSo B) 24 is the correct answer."
"Let's consider the functions L(x,y) and R(x,y) for different values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where x and y are both integers. In this case, [x] = x, [y] = y, [x+y] = x+y, [2x] = 2x, and [2y] = 2y. So, L(x,y) = x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y = R(x,y). Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).\n\nNext, let's consider the case where x and y are not integers. Let's take x = 1.5 and y = 2.5 as an example. In this case, [x] = 1, [y] = 2, [x+y] = 3, [2x] = 3, and [2y] = 5. So, L(x,y) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 and R(x,y) = 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where x and y are fractions such that 0 < x, y < 1. Let's take x = 0.5 and y = 0.4 as an example. In this case, [x] = 0, [y] = 0, [x+y] = 0, [2x] = 1, and [2y] = 0. So, L(x,y) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 and R(x,y) = 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y).\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where x and y are such that x + y > 1 but x, y < 1. Let's take x = 0.6 and y = 0.7 as an example. In this case, [x] = 0, [y] = 0, [x+y] = 1, [2x] = 1, and [2y] = 1. So, L(x,y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 and R(x,y) = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) > R(x,y).\n\nSo, it is not impossible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y), L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y), L(x,y) < R(x,y), or L(x,y) > R(x,y). Therefore, the answer is E) None."

In this case, the LCM is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720 seconds.\n\n720 seconds is equal to 12 minutes. \n\nSo, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) After 12 minutes.'
"The height of the electric pole and its shadow form a right triangle with the sun's rays. The same is true for the tree and its shadow. Since the conditions are similar, the ratios of the corresponding sides of these triangles are equal. This is a property of similar triangles.\n\nSo, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n14 (height of the pole) / 10 (shadow of the pole) = h (height of the tree) / 15 (shadow of the tree)\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh = 14 * 15 / 10 = 21\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 21 metres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 21."
"The cost of each fruit is determined by the number of vowels in its name multiplied by 9. An orange has 2 vowels (o, a) so it costs 18 dollars. A pineapple has 4 vowels (i, e, a, e) so it costs 36 dollars. A grape has 2 vowels (a, e) so it costs 18 dollars. \n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the question as it states that a pineapple costs 27 dollars instead of 36 dollars. \n\nAssuming the pattern holds, a mango, which has 2 vowels (a, o), would cost 18 dollars. So the answer would be D) 18 dollars. \n\nBut if we consider the mistake in the pineapple's cost, it seems that the cost is determined by the number of vowels minus 1, multiplied by 9. In this case, a mango, which has 2 vowels, would cost 9 dollars, which is not an option in the answer choices. \n\nSo, based on the information given and assuming the pattern holds, the answer would be D) 18 dollars."
'The area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula 1/2 * base * height. \n\nThe base of the triangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of the points on the x-axis, which is |a-b|. \n\nThe height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of the point not on the x-axis, which is |y|. \n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 1/2 * |a-b| * |y|. \n\nHowever, we know that a > b and y < 0, so |a-b| = a - b and |y| = -y. \n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the area of the triangle, we get 1/2 * (a - b) * -y = -(a - b)y / 2. \n\nThis simplifies to (b - a)y / 2, which is equivalent to (by - ay) / 2. \n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is represented by (by - ay) / 2, which corresponds to answer choice C.'

'The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter answer correctly. \n\nThe probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5. The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6. \n\nHowever, we must also consider the possibility that both Alan and Peter answer correctly. This is the intersection of the two events, and the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities, which is (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nThe probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring. \n\nSo, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = 1/5 + 4/6 = 1/5 + 2/3 = 3/15 + 10/15 = 13/15.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices, which suggests that the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one of Alan or Peter answers correctly (not both). \n\nThe probability that exactly one of them answers correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities minus twice the probability of both events occurring. \n\nSo, the probability that exactly one of them answers correctly is (1/5) + (5/6) - 2*(1/6) = 1/5 + 4/6 - 1/3 = 3/15 + 10/15 - 5/15 = 8/15.\n\nAgain, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nThe problem may be asking for the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly. \n\nThe probability that at least one of them answers correctly is 1 minus the probability that neither of them answers correctly. \n\nThe probability that neither of them answers correctly is the product of their individual probabilities of not answering correctly, which is (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of them answers correctly is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nAgain, this is not one of the answer choices. \n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.'

According to the problem, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. \n\nSince 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, this means that 50% of the files, or 125 files, were infected by a virus. These files are either infected by both a virus and a worm (x files) or only by a virus. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected only by a virus is 125 - x - 2.5x = 125 - 3.5x.\n\nHowever, since all files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both, the number of files infected only by a virus must be 0. \n\nSo, we have the equation 125 - 3.5x = 0. Solving for x gives x = 125 / 3.5 = 35.71. However, the number of files must be an integer, so we round this to 36. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 36, and the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * 36 = 90. \n\nThe total number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm) is 90 + 36 = 126. \n\nTherefore, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is the total number of files minus the number of files infected by a worm, or 250 - 126 = 124. \n\nHowever, since the number of files must be an integer, we round this to 125. \n\nSo, the answer is E) 125."
"The father wants both sons to have the same amount of money when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26) and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26).\n\nLet's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100.\n\nSince the money is invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, the future value of the investments can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the future value of the investment, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for (in years).\n\nIn this case, n = 1 (since interest is compounded annually), r = 0.04 (4% in decimal form), t = 3 for Mohan and t = 2 for Sohan. The father wants A to be the same for both sons, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nM(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) = S(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*2)\n\nSolving this equation for S gives us S = M(1.04)^3 / (1.04)^2 = M(1.04).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation M + S = 5100 gives us M + M(1.04) = 5100, which simplifies to 2.04M = 5100.\n\nSolving for M gives us M = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nSo, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500. The answer is B)2500."
'The first step is to find 30% of 1400 grams. To do this, you multiply 1400 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). \n\n1400 * 0.30 = 420 grams\n\nSo, 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nThe next step is to find 60% of 420 grams. To do this, you multiply 420 by 0.60 (which is the decimal equivalent of 60%).\n\n420 * 0.60 = 252 grams\n\nSo, 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nTherefore, 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is 252 grams.\n\nSo, the answer is C) 252 grams.'
'The rate of the liquid passing through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. This can be converted to gallons per second by dividing w by 25x, giving us a rate of (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWe need to find out how long it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. To do this, we divide y by the rate, giving us y/(w/(25x)) = y*(25x/w) seconds.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time in minutes, not seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we need to convert our time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. This gives us (y*(25x/w))/60 = y*(25x/(60w)) = 5xy/(12w) minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 5xy/(12w).'
"The volume of the first coin is $\\pi \\cdot (7.5)^2 \\cdot 2 = 112.5\\pi$ cubic millimeters. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, each metal contributes $112.5\\pi/2 = 56.25\\pi$ cubic millimeters to the volume. \n\nLet's denote the weight of 1 cubic millimeter of aluminum as $a$ grams and the weight of 1 cubic millimeter of silver as $s$ grams. We know that $s = 2a$ (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum) and that the total weight of the coin is $30$ grams. \n\nSo, we can write the equation: $56.25\\pi a + 56.25\\pi \\cdot 2a = 30$. Solving this equation for $a$, we find that $a = 30/(56.25\\pi \\cdot 3) = 0.169 \\text{ grams/mm}^3$.\n\nThe volume of the second coin is $\\pi \\cdot (15)^2 \\cdot 1 = 225\\pi$ cubic millimeters. Since it's made of pure aluminum, its weight is $225\\pi \\cdot 0.169 = 120$ grams. \n\nHowever, the second coin is 4 times larger than the first coin (since the area of the base is 4 times larger and the height is twice as small). Therefore, the weight of the second coin should be 4 times smaller than calculated, which gives us $120/4 = 30$ grams. \n\nSo, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 30 grams. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices matches this result. There might be a mistake in the problem statement or in the answer choices."
"Let's denote the unknown number as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, 2/3 of the number minus 10 equals 40 plus 1/3 of the number. We can write this relationship as an equation:\n\n2/3*x - 10 = 40 + 1/3*x\n\nTo solve for x, we first get rid of the fractions by multiplying every term by 3:\n\n2*x - 30 = 120 + x\n\nThen, we isolate x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:\n\n2*x - x = 120 + 30\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 150\n\nSo, the number is 150, which corresponds to answer choice C."
"The largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 6. \n\nAs per the hint, the discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by b^2 - 4ac. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. \n\nSubstituting the given values into the discriminant, we get (-5)^2 - 4*1*k = 25 - 4k. \n\nFor the roots to be real and distinct, 25 - 4k > 0. Simplifying this inequality gives k < 25/4 = 6.25. \n\nThe largest integral value of 'k' that satisfies this inequality is 6. \n\nHowever, this option is not given in the answer choices. This could be due to a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 6."
'The result of the calculation 900 + 5 × 12 is 960.\n\nAccording to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition. So, we first multiply 5 by 12, which equals 60. Then, we add this result to 900. \n\n900 + 60 equals 960. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) 960.'
"Shweta's speed is 10 km per hour. Therefore, without considering the rest time, she would take 100 km / 10 km/hour = 10 hours to cover the distance.\n\nHowever, she stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. So, for every 15 km, she takes an additional 10 minutes or 10/60 = 1/6 hour.\n\nThe total number of 15 km segments in 100 km is 100 km / 15 km = 6.67. Since she can't stop in the middle of a segment, we round this up to 7 stops.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken including rest is 10 hours (riding time) + 7 * 1/6 hours (rest time) = 10 hours + 7/6 hours = 11.17 hours.\n\nSo, Shweta will take approximately 11 hours and 10 minutes to cover 100 km. The closest answer choice is C) 11 hours."
"Let's denote the time it takes to travel by train as T and the time it takes to travel by car as C. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that T + C = 17 hours. \n\nWe also know that if Mr. Sam travels both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that 2T = 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours. \n\nSo, the time it takes to travel by train is T = 21 hours / 2 = 10.5 hours. \n\nSubstituting T = 10.5 hours into the first equation, we get 10.5 hours + C = 17 hours. \n\nSolving for C, we find that C = 17 hours - 10.5 hours = 6.5 hours. \n\nIf Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car, he would have taken 2C = 2 * 6.5 hours = 13 hours. \n\nSo, the answer is E) 13 hours."
'The dog ate at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, and 11:00 am before noon. This is a total of 4 times. \n\nEach time the dog ate, it consumed 1/3 of the remaining food. This means that 2/3 of the food was left after each feeding. \n\nTo find the amount of food left after 4 feedings, we multiply the original amount of food by (2/3) four times. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding $(2/3)^4$ of the original amount of food. \n\n$(2/3)^4 = 16/81 \\approx 0.198$, or approximately 19.8%. \n\nSo, right before the dog began to eat at noon, approximately 20% of the original food was left in the bowl. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 20\\%}$.'
'Since 75% of the men preferred red cars, this means that 25% of the men preferred green cars. If 10 men represent this 25%, we can find out the total number of men surveyed by setting up the equation:\n\n25/100 = 10/x\n\nSolving for x gives us x = 40. This means 40 men were surveyed.\n\nSince 60% of the people surveyed were women, this means that 40% were men. If 40 men represent this 40%, we can find out the total number of people surveyed by setting up the equation:\n\n40/100 = 40/x\n\nSolving for x gives us x = 100. \n\nSo, 100 people took the survey. The answer is A) 100.'
"This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. \n\nLet's denote the number of ways to reach the i-th step by dp[i]. \n\nThe base cases are dp[0] = 1 (there is only one way to stay at the bottom of the stairs) and dp[1] = 1 (there is only one way to reach the first step).\n\nFor i > 1, the boy can reach the i-th step either from the (i-1)-th step or from the (i-2)-th step. Therefore, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].\n\nWe can calculate dp[i] for i = 2, 3, ..., 10 and find dp[10].\n\nHere is the calculation:\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3\ndp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 3 + 2 = 5\ndp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 5 + 3 = 8\ndp[6] = dp[5] + dp[4] = 8 + 5 = 13\ndp[7] = dp[6] + dp[5] = 13 + 8 = 21\ndp[8] = dp[7] + dp[6] = 21 + 13 = 34\ndp[9] = dp[8] + dp[7] = 34 + 21 = 55\ndp[10] = dp[9] + dp[8] = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nSo, there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs.

"The current soft drink is one gallon and is made up of 40% orange juice. This means that the amount of orange juice in the soft drink is 0.4 gallons (40% of 1 gallon).\n\nWe want to add more orange juice to make it 60% of the total soft drink. Let's denote the amount of orange juice we need to add as x gallons. After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink will be 1 + x gallons.\n\nThe amount of orange juice in the new soft drink will be 0.4 + x gallons, and this should be 60% of the total soft drink. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nSolving this equation for x gives:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n0.4 = 0.6 - 0.6x\n0.4 = 0.6(1 - x)\nx = (0.6 - 0.4) / 0.6\nx = 0.2 / 0.6\nx = 1/3 ≈ 0.33 gallons\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this result. There seems to be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If the problem is correct, then the amount of orange juice that needs to be added is approximately 0.33 gallons."

'The total number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial. \n\nSo, the total number of ways to select 2 horses out of 5 is C(5, 2) = 5! / [2!(5-2)!] = 10.\n\nNow, no matter which 2 horses Mr. Jain selects, one of them could be the winning horse. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes for each of the 10 total outcomes, giving a total of 2*10 = 20 favorable outcomes.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted each favorable outcome (once for each of the 2 horses Mr. Jain could have selected), so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this, giving 20 / 2 = 10 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, or 10 / 10 = 1.\n\nBut since there can only be one winning horse, we need to divide this probability by the total number of horses, or 5, to get the final probability.\n\nSo, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 1 / 5 = 0.2, or 2/5.\n\nSo, the answer is B) 2/5.'

"Let's assume the original price of the tyre is $100.\n\nFirst, the manufacturer offers a 20% discount. So, the price after the manufacturer's discount is $100 - 20% of $100 = $100 - $20 = $80.\n\nNext, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the reduced price of $80. So, the price after the retailer's discount is $80 - 20% of $80 = $80 - $16 = $64.\n\nSo, the total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36.\n\nTherefore, the total discount available at that retailer is 36% of the original price.\n\nSo, the answer is E) 36%."
'The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. This means that one of the sides of the rectangle is 9 feet. \n\nThe sum of the lengths of the three painted sides is 37 feet. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, this means that the sum of the lengths of the other three sides (two of which are equal) is 37 feet. \n\nTo find the length of the other side of the rectangle, we subtract the length of the unpainted side from the total length of the three painted sides. \n\nSo, the length of the other side is 37 feet - 9 feet = 28 feet. \n\nHowever, this length is double the actual length of the other side (since a rectangle has two sides of equal length). So, we divide this length by 2 to find the actual length of the other side. \n\nSo, the length of the other side is 28 feet / 2 = 14 feet. \n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the area of the parking space is 9 feet * 14 feet = 126 square feet. \n\nSo, the answer is C) 126.'

"Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in one hour. This is Jack's rate of cleaning.\n\nJack completes two-thirds of the work, so there is one-third of the work remaining. Since Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, one-third of the yacht would take him 12/3 = 4 hours.\n\nJill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate. So, Jill can clean 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in one hour.\n\nTo find out how long it takes Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work, we divide the amount of work (1/3 of the yacht) by Jill's rate (1/240 of the yacht per hour).\n\n(1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours\n\nSo, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. It's possible that there was a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, it should take her 20 times longer to do the same amount of work.

This is because the total cost of 27 bottles is A cents, so to find the cost of one bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles.\n\nTo convert this cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100, because there are 100 cents in a dollar. So, the cost of one bottle of soda in dollars is A/2700.\n\nIf we want to find out the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars, we multiply the cost of one bottle (in dollars) by the number of bottles. This gives us B*(A/2700).\n\nThis simplifies to AB/2700. Therefore, the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars is AB/2700.\n\nSo, the answer is A) AB/2700.'
'To find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4, we need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that can be selected.\n\n1. Three $2 candy bars: There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to select three $2 candy bars.\n\n2. Two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are $\\binom{4}{2} * \\binom{4}{1} = 24$ ways to select two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar.\n\n3. Two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar: There are $\\binom{4}{2} * \\binom{3}{1} = 18$ ways to select two $2 candy bars and one $0.50 candy bar.\n\n4. One $2 candy bar, one $1 candy bar, and one $0.50 candy bar: This combination only costs $3.50, which is not more than $4, so it is not considered.\n\n5. One $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: There are $\\binom{4}{1} * \\binom{4}{2} = 24$ ways to select one $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars.\n\nAdding these up, there are $4 + 24 + 18 + 24 = 70$ ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }70}$.'
'The total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 8 people is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$. \n\nHowever, this includes the cases where all the presenters are men or all the presenters are women. We need to subtract these cases.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 presenters all of whom are men is $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$. \n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 4 presenters all of whom are women is also $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$. \n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters such that the team is not composed of men only or women only is $70 - 1 - 1 = 68$.\n\nBut, we also need to subtract the cases where there are 3 men and 1 woman or 3 women and 1 man.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 men and 1 woman is $\\binom{4}{3} * \\binom{4}{1} = 4 * 4 = 16$.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 3 women and 1 man is also $16$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $68 - 16 - 16 = 36$.\n\nHowever, this is not in the answer choices.

"If 2/5th of the children in the class are girls, this means that 3/5th of the children are boys. If 100 boys represent 3/5th of the class, then 1/5th of the class is 100/3 = 33.33 (approximately). Therefore, 2/5th of the class, which represents the girls, is 33.33 * 2 = 66.66 (approximately). However, since we can't have a fraction of a child, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. So, there are approximately 67 girls in the class. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. \n\nThere might be a mistake in the problem. If we assume that the boys represent 2/5th of the class, then the girls would represent 3/5th of the class. In this case, 1/5th of the class would be 50 (since 100 boys represent 2/5th of the class), and 3/5th of the class would be 50 * 3 = 150. So, there would be 150 girls in the class. This option (C) is available in the answer choices."
'The prime factorization of 1,000 is $2^3 * 5^3$. This means that any number that is relatively prime to 1,000 cannot have 2 or 5 as a factor.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are not relatively prime to 1,000. First, we count the numbers that are divisible by 2. There are 500 such numbers. Then, we count the numbers that are divisible by 5. There are 200 such numbers. However, we have double-counted the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10). There are 100 such numbers. Therefore, we subtract 100 from our total.\n\nThis gives us a total of 500 + 200 - 100 = 600 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are not relatively prime to 1,000.\n\nTherefore, there are 1,000 - 600 = 400 numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.\n\nThe probability that a number chosen from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000 is therefore 400/1,000 = 2/5.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 2/5}$.'
'The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\nA = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\nP = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)\nr = annual interest rate (in decimal)\nn = number of times that interest is compounded per year\nt = time the money is invested for in years\n\nGiven that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08 (in decimal), n = 2 (since interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year, we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for P:\n\n$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)\n$54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2\n$54,080 = P(1.04)^2\n$54,080 = P*1.0816\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.0816 to solve for P:\n\nP = $54,080 / 1.0816 = $50,000\n\nSo, Charles originally invested $50,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) $50,000.'
"Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n1) J + S + F = 100 (the sum of their ages is 100)\n\n2) F - J = S (when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice her current age)\n\n3) F + (F - J) = 2(F - S) (when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father)\n\nNow we can solve these equations step by step:\n\nFrom equation 2), we can express S as S = F - J. \n\nSubstitute S into equation 1), we get J + F - J + F = 100, which simplifies to 2F = 100, so F = 50.\n\nSubstitute F = 50 into equation 2), we get S = 50 - J.\n\nSubstitute F = 50 and S = 50 - J into equation 3), we get 50 + (50 - J) = 2(50 - (50 - J)), which simplifies to J = 25.\n\nSo, Joe's father is 50 years old. The answer is C)50."
'The problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. This can be written as (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21, where x is the number we are trying to find.\n\nTo solve for x, we can first multiply the fractions on the left side of the equation:\n\n(1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4\n\nSo, the equation becomes (1/4) * x = 21.\n\nTo isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n4 * (1/4) * x = 4 * 21\nx = 84\n\nTherefore, the number is 84. So, the correct answer is A) 84.'
'From the problem, we know that x = m/100 * 4y. We can rearrange this equation to solve for m: m = x * 100 / 4y.\n\nWe are asked to find m as a percentage of x. This can be written as m = ?/100 * x. Substituting the expression for m from above, we get:\n\nx * 100 / 4y = ?/100 * x.\n\nSolving for ?, we get ? = 40000/y.\n\nTherefore, m is 40000/y percent of x. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to convert this to a form that matches one of the answer choices.\n\nWe can do this by dividing the numerator and denominator by 1000 to get ? = 40/y. This is still not one of the answer choices.\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by 10, we get ? = 4/y. This is still not one of the answer choices.\n\nFinally, dividing the numerator and denominator by 4, we get ? = 1/y. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2500, we get ? = 2500/y.\n\nTherefore, in terms of y, m is 2500/y percent of x. The answer is (D) 2500/y.'
'The man has 6 different types of fruit to choose from for breakfast. So, there are 6 ways he can eat breakfast.\n\nSimilarly, he has 8 different types of vegetables to choose from for dinner. So, there are 8 ways he can eat dinner.\n\nSince these are two separate events (eating breakfast and eating dinner), we multiply the number of ways he can eat breakfast by the number of ways he can eat dinner to get the total number of ways he can eat both meals.\n\nSo, the total number of ways he can eat breakfast and dinner is 6 * 8 = 48.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 48.'
'The probability of an event can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that exactly 4 out of 5 randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election, given that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election.\n\nSo, we have:\n- n = 5 (the number of voters chosen)\n- k = 4 (the number of voters who voted)\n- p = 0.9 (the probability that a voter voted)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (0.9^4) * ((1-0.9)^(5-4))\n\nCalculating the combinations, C(5, 4) = 5.\n\nSo,\n\nP(X=4) = 5 * (0.9^4) * (0.1^1)\n\nP(X=4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1\n\nP(X=4) = 0.32805\n\nSo, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election, given that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election, is approximately 32.8%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 32.8%.'
"The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length x width. We know that one side (let's call it the length) is 10 meters and the area is 240 square meters. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n10 x width = 240\n\nSolving for width, we get:\n\nwidth = 240 / 10 = 24 meters\n\nSo, the other side of the rectangle (the width) is 24 meters.\n\nAlice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard. That means she needs to fence the length, the width, and the length again (since one length is left unfenced). So, the total length of fencing she needs is:\n\n10 meters (length) + 24 meters (width) + 10 meters (length) = 44 meters\n\nSo, Alice needs 44 meters of fencing. However, this is not one of the answer choices. There might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. If the width was 34 meters instead of 24 meters, then the total length of fencing would be 54 meters, which is still not one of the answer choices.

"First, we need to find out the distance from the worker's home to his work. We know that speed equals distance divided by time. So, we can rearrange this formula to find distance: distance equals speed times time. \n\nThe worker drives at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour for 9 minutes. But we need to convert the time to hours since the speed is given in kilometers per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is 9/60 = 0.15 hours.\n\nSo, the distance from home to work is 20 kilometers per hour * 0.15 hours = 3 kilometers.\n\nNow, we know the distance and we know the worker's cycling speed, so we can find out how long it will take him to cycle to work. We rearrange the speed formula again to find time: time equals distance divided by speed.\n\nSo, the time it will take the worker to cycle to work is 3 kilometers / 6 kilometers per hour = 0.5 hours.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. So we convert 0.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.5 hours * 60 = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 30."
