'1. The expression for x can be simplified by factoring the numerator and denominator. The numerator can be factored as (n + 2√n + 4)^2 and the denominator can be factored as (n + 2√n + 2)^2.\n2. This simplification allows us to cancel out the common factors, leaving x = (n + 2√n + 4) / (n + 2√n + 2).\n3. The value of x is a function of n, and n is constrained to be between 36 and 72.\n4. By substituting the lower and upper bounds of n into the simplified expression for x, we can find the range of possible values for x.\n5. Substituting n = 36 into the expression for x gives x = 20, and substituting n = 72 gives x = 54.\n6. Therefore, the range of possible values for x is 20 < x < 54, which corresponds to answer choice A.'

"1. The quadratic equation is in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.\n2. For a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than 0.\n3. Substituting the given values, the discriminant becomes (-5)^2 - 4*1*k = 25 - 4k.\n4. For the roots to be real and distinct, 25 - 4k > 0, which simplifies to k < 25/4 = 6.25.\n5. The largest integral value of 'k' that satisfies this inequality is 6. However, this option is not given in the answer choices.\n6. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices."

If a number has 5 factors, its prime factorization must be in the form of $p^4$ or $p^2*q^1$, where p and q are prime numbers.\n2. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime number. This is true because if Q is the square of a prime number, its prime factorization would be in the form of $p^2$, which has 3 factors, not 5. \n3. Statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. This is true because if Q is the fourth power of a prime number, its prime factorization would be in the form of $p^4$, which has 5 factors.\n4. Statement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. This is not necessarily true because if Q is the product of two prime numbers, its prime factorization would be in the form of $p^1*q^1$, which has 4 factors, not 5. \n5. Therefore, the correct answer is D) I and II only.'

'1. The prime factorization of 1,000 is $2^3 * 5^3$.\n2. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not contain 2 or 5 as a factor.\n3. There are 500 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are divisible by 2 and 200 numbers that are divisible by 5.\n4. However, numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10) have been counted twice, so we subtract the 100 numbers divisible by 10.\n5. Therefore, there are 500 + 200 - 100 = 600 numbers between 1 and 1,000 that are not relatively prime to 1,000.\n6. This means there are 1,000 - 600 = 400 numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.\n7. The probability that a number chosen from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000 is therefore 400/1,000 = 2/5.'
