"Let's assume that there were x roses in the vase at the beginning.\nAfter Jessica cut 16 more roses, the total number of roses in the vase became x + 16.\nSince there are now 23 roses in the vase, we can write the equation x + 16 = 23.\nSubtracting 16 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 23 - 16 = <<23-16=7>>7.\nTherefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning. Answer: \\boxed{7}."
'The frog jumped 19 + 39 = <<19+39=58>>58 inches farther than the grasshopper.\nSo, the frog jumped 19 + 58 = <<19+58=77>>77 inches.\nTherefore, the frog jumped 77 - 94 = <<77-94=-17>>-17 inches lesser than the mouse.\nSince the distance cannot be negative, the frog jumped 77 inches.

'You have 7 bags of cookies.'
"Let's call the distance the frog jumped x inches.\nThe grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 19 inches.\nThe mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 12 inches.\nThe total distance jumped by all three is x + (x + 19) + (x - 12) = 39 inches.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 7 = 39.\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we get 3x = 32.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 10.67 inches.\nTherefore, the mouse jumped x - 12 = 10.67 - 12 = -1.33 inches.\nSince it is not possible for the mouse to jump a negative distance, there must be an error in the problem statement."
'To find the number of drums of grapes filled per day, we need to divide the total number of drums filled in 6 days by the number of days.\n\nTotal number of drums filled in 6 days = 90 drums\nNumber of days = 6 days\n\nNumber of drums filled per day = 90 drums / 6 days = <<90/6=15>>15 drums/day\n\nTherefore, 15 drums of grapes would be filled per day.'
