'To find out how many children got off the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children left on the bus from the total number of children that were originally on the bus. \n\nSo, 43 (total number of children on the bus) - 21 (number of children left on the bus) = 22 children.\n\nTherefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.'
'Initially, there were 28 children on the bus. Then 82 children got on the bus, making a total of 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus. However, after some children got off, there were only 30 children left on the bus. This means that 110 - 30 = 80 children must have gotten off the bus.\n\nTherefore, the number of children who got on the bus (82) minus the number who got off (80) is 82 - 80 = 2. So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.'
'Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet. She then collected 49 dollars from the atm, making her total money 52 dollars (3 dollars + 49 dollars). After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left. This means she spent 3 dollars at the supermarket (52 dollars - 49 dollars).\n\nTherefore, Olivia collected 46 dollars more at the atm than she spent at the supermarket (49 dollars - 3 dollars).'
'Jerry initially had 3 action figures on his shelf before he added 7 more. This is because if he now has 10 action figures and he added 7, then he must have had 10 - 7 = 3 action figures to start with.'
'Paco ate 9 more cookies than those he gave to his friend. \n\nDetails: \nPaco ate 18 cookies and gave 9 cookies to his friend. To find out how many more cookies Paco ate than those he gave to his friend, we subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate. \n\nSo, 18 (cookies eaten) - 9 (cookies given) = 9 more cookies eaten.'
'Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour to her cake recipe. This is because the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour in total and she has already added 6 cups. By subtracting the 6 cups she has already added from the total 10 cups required, we find that she still needs to add 4 more cups.'
'The waiter initially had 21 customers. This is because after 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers. Therefore, before the 9 customers left, he must have had 9 customers + 12 customers = 21 customers.'
'After 6 more storks and 2 more birds joined the initial 3 birds, there are now 6 storks and 5 birds (3 initial birds + 2 more birds) on the fence. Therefore, there is 1 more stork than birds sitting on the fence.'
'They have 143 chairs in the backyard. This is because each set of tables comes with 13 chairs, and they have 11 sets. So, you multiply the number of sets (11) by the number of chairs per set (13) to get the total number of chairs, which is 143.'
'There are 692 girls in the school and 458 more girls than boys. This means there are 692 - 458 = 234 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 692 girls + 234 boys = 926 pupils.'
"Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who stands at 13 feet. Therefore, Dean is 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet tall. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, so the water is 15 times * 17 feet = 255 feet deep."
'After 4 more birds and 8 more storks joined the initial 6 birds, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence. This is because storks are also a type of bird. So, the total number of birds is the sum of the initial birds, the additional birds, and the storks (6+4+8=18).'
"After Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries, the total weight of the strawberries they had was 36 - 8 = 28 pounds. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds, his dad's strawberries weighed 28 - 12 = 16 pounds."
'There are 469 boys in the school.\n\nDetails:\nAccording to the information given, there are 697 girls in the school and there are 228 more girls than boys.

'The total number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items is the sum of the students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and those who suggested adding bacon to the menu. \n\nSo, the total number of students who participated is 450 (students who suggested mashed potatoes) + 38 (students who suggested bacon) = 488 students. \n\nTherefore, 488 students participated in the suggestion of new food items.'
"Matthew could only distribute the same number of crackers and cakes to each friend if he had an equal number of each. Since he had fewer crackers (13) than cakes (15), he could only distribute 13 crackers and 13 cakes equally among his friends.\n\nSo, each of Matthew's 28 friends ate 13/28 crackers and 13/28 cakes. However, since it's not possible to divide a single cracker or cake into 28 parts, we can say that not every friend received a cracker or a cake. \n\nIn other words, Matthew could not distribute the crackers and cakes equally among all his friends."
'The grocery store had 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda. To find the total number of regular and diet soda bottles, you add the two amounts together. \n\n49 (regular soda) + 40 (diet soda) = 89 bottles\n\nSo, the grocery store had 89 bottles of regular and diet soda altogether.'
"Each candy bar cost $2. \n\nHere's how we know: Dan spent a total of $4 on 2 candy bars. Since each candy bar costs the same amount, we can find the cost of each by dividing the total cost by the number of candy bars. So, $4 ÷ 2 = $2. Therefore, each candy bar cost $2."

'Jack received 1 email in the evening.\n\nDetails:\nIn the morning, Jack received 6 emails. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails. So, the total number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon is 6 + 3 = 9 emails. Since he received a total of 10 emails in the day, and he received 9 emails in the morning and afternoon, he must have received 10 - 9 = 1 email in the evening.'
"Dan is left with $1. \n\nHere's the detailed calculation: \n\nDan initially has $4. He spent $8 on a candy bar. This means he is short of $4 (because 4 - 8 = -4). \n\nThen, his friend gave him $5. If we add this to his current amount (-$4), he now has $1 left (because -4 + 5 = 1). \n\nSo, Dan has $1 left after buying a candy bar and receiving money from his friend."
'The question states that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 246 visitors came on the current day. However, it does not provide information on the number of visitors for the remaining 23 days. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only confirm that 949 visitors (703 from the previous day + 246 from the current day) visited the Buckingham Palace within these 2 days. Without additional information, we cannot determine the total number of visitors within 25 days.'

"After Allan bought 2 more balloons at the park, he had a total of 3 (initial balloons) + 2 (additional balloons) = 5 balloons.\n\nJake had brought 5 balloons to the park.\n\nSo, together, Allan and Jake had 5 (Allan's balloons) + 5 (Jake's balloons) = 10 balloons in the park."
'Josh now has 8 marbles. This is because he initially had 19 marbles and he lost 11. If you subtract 11 from 19, you get 8. Therefore, Josh now has 8 marbles left in his collection.'
'After Jake bought 4 more balloons at the park, he had a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 balloons.\n\nAllan had 6 balloons.\n\nSo, Jake had 7 - 6 = <<7-6=1>>1 more balloon than Allan in the park.'
'Faye has 154 pencils. This is because if she is placing her pencils into 14 rows with 11 pencils in each row, we can find the total number of pencils by multiplying the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row. So, 14 rows times 11 pencils per row equals 154 pencils.'
'The grocery store had 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda. This is calculated by subtracting the number of regular soda bottles (22) from the number of diet soda bottles (61). So, 61 - 22 = 39.'
'There are a total of 96 red peaches in the 6 baskets. \n\nDetails: \nSince each basket contains 16 red peaches, to find the total number of red peaches in all 6 baskets, you multiply the number of baskets by the number of red peaches in each basket. \n\nSo, 6 baskets * 16 red peaches/basket = 96 red peaches.'
'To find out how many kids stayed home during summer break, we need to subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.\n\nSo, 828521 (total kids) - 800059 (kids who went to camp) = 28462 kids.\n\nTherefore, 28462 kids from Lawrence county stayed home during summer break.'
'The total number of flowers in all the pots is calculated by multiplying the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot. \n\nSo, 141 pots * 71 flowers/pot = 10,011 flowers. \n\nTherefore, there are 10,011 flowers in all the pots.'
'Allan initially had 2 balloons and then bought 3 more at the park, so he had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Jake had 4 balloons. Therefore, Allan had 5 - 4 = 1 balloon more than Jake in the park after Allan bought 3 more balloons.'
'The chef had 58 apples and used 35 for making pies. To find out how many apples remained, we subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples. \n\nSo, 58 - 35 = 23\n\nTherefore, the chef had 23 apples remaining after making the pies.'
'Each bag has 2 cookies. \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the total number of cookies (52) by the total number of bags (26). So, 52 cookies / 26 bags = 2 cookies per bag.'
"After 49 days of harvest, they will have 1862 sacks of oranges. \n\nHere's how you calculate it: \n\nThey harvest 38 sacks per day. So, over the course of 49 days, they would have harvested a total of 38 sacks/day * 49 days = 1862 sacks. \n\nThe number of oranges in each sack does not affect the total number of sacks, so it is not necessary to consider it in this calculation."
'Jessica cut 4 orchids from her flower garden. This is because there were originally 3 orchids in the vase and now there are 7. The difference between these two amounts (7-3) is 4, which is the number of orchids Jessica must have cut and added to the vase.'
'Jack received 1 more email in the afternoon than in the evening.'
'Faye has a total of 84 pencils. This is because if each pack contains 14 pencils, and she has 6 packs, you would multiply 14 by 6 to get the total number of pencils. So, 14 pencils/pack * 6 packs = 84 pencils.'
"The farmer had 160 tomatoes and he picked 56 of them yesterday. So, to find out how many tomatoes he had left after yesterday's picking, we subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had. \n\nSo, 160 (total tomatoes) - 56 (picked tomatoes) = 104 tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, the farmer had 104 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking."
'To find out how many pots there are, you need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each pot. \n\nSo, 400 flowers ÷ 40 flowers/pot = 10 pots\n\nTherefore, there are 10 pots in total.'
'In the morning, 15 campers went rowing. By the end of the day, a total of 32 campers had gone rowing. To find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing that day.\n\nSo, 32 (total campers) - 15 (morning campers) = 17 campers.\n\nTherefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.'
'There were 10 more students who suggested adding bacon to the menu than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes.'
'Doug initially had 25 marbles. \n\nSince Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, and Ed had 27 marbles, that means Doug had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles after he lost 3 at the playground. Therefore, before Doug lost his marbles, he must have had 22 + 3 = 25 marbles.'
'Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework. \n\nThis is because, according to the problem, Rachel had 7 pages of math homework, which is 4 pages more than her reading homework. Therefore, to find out how many pages of reading homework she had, we subtract 4 from 7 (the total number of math pages). This gives us 3 pages of reading homework.'
'Helen baked a total of 19 + 237 = <<19+237=256>>256 chocolate chip cookies.\nTherefore, Helen baked 256 - 231 = <<256-231=25>>25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.'
'Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday. This is because if she found 4 more bags the next day and had a total of 8 bags, then she must have started with 4 bags (8 total - 4 found = 4 original).'
"Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park. \n\nHere's how you can find the answer: \n\nFirst, you need to know how many bottle caps Danny threw away and how many he found. According to the problem, Danny found 30 bottle caps at the park and threw away 63. \n\nTo find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, you subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the number he threw away. \n\nSo, 63 (the number of bottle caps thrown away) - 30 (the number of bottle caps found) = 33. \n\nTherefore, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park."
'Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar because she has already added 10 cups and the recipe calls for 12 cups. The recipe also calls for 14 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 14 cups of flour. \n\nSo, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than she does sugar because 14 cups of flour minus 2 cups of sugar equals 12 cups.'
'Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to have a total of 140 games. This is because 140 (the total number of games she wants) minus 22 (the number of games she currently has) equals 118.'
'Each package contains 5 white t-shirts. \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the total number of t-shirts (70) by the total number of packages (14). So, 70 ÷ 14 = 5. Therefore, each package contains 5 white t-shirts.'
'The farmer picked a total of 134 tomatoes yesterday and 30 tomatoes today, which is a total of 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes.\n\nHe initially had 171 tomatoes, so after picking 164, he will have 171 - 164 = 7 tomatoes left in his garden.'
'Fred initially had 47 dollars. He then earned 111 dollars from delivering newspapers and 34 dollars from washing cars. To find out how much money Fred has now, we need to add all these amounts together.\n\nSo, 47 (initial amount) + 111 (money from newspapers) + 34 (money from car washing) = 192 dollars.\n\nTherefore, Fred now has 192 dollars.'
'Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour to her cake mixture. This is because the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and she has already added 7 cups. By subtracting the 7 cups she has already added from the total 14 cups required, we find that she still needs to add 7 more cups.'
'There are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now. \n\nDetails: \n- The number of roses in the vase is 11.\n- The number of orchids in the vase is 20.\n- To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase, subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids (20 - 11 = 9). So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase.'
'Jessie now weighs 34 kilograms. This is because she initially weighed 69 kilograms and she lost 35 kilograms from jogging. So, 69 kilograms - 35 kilograms = 34 kilograms.'
'Initially, there were 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 more children got on the bus, making a total of 62 children on the bus. However, after some children got off, there were only 2 children left on the bus. This means that 60 children must have gotten off the bus at the bus stop.'
"You have read 1 more book than the number of movies you have watched in the 'crazy silly school' series."
'Emily used a total of 308 beads to make 11 necklaces. This is because for each necklace, she used 28 beads. So, if you multiply the number of necklaces (11) by the number of beads per necklace (28), you get the total number of beads used (308).'
"The farmer still has all 175 tomatoes because the question does not mention that he picked any tomatoes. However, he picked 172 out of his 77 potatoes. But it's impossible to pick 172 potatoes if he only had 77. There seems to be a mistake in the question. If we assume that he picked 72 potatoes instead, he would have 5 potatoes left. So, the farmer would have 175 tomatoes and 5 potatoes left."
'Fred and Jason earned a total of 8 dollars over the weekend. Fred earned 4 dollars by washing cars (115-111=4) and Jason earned 4 dollars by delivering newspapers (44-40=4).'
'The mailman should give 180 pieces of junk mail in each block. This is because there are 20 houses on each block and he has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house. So, 20 houses multiplied by 9 pieces of junk mail equals 180 pieces of junk mail.'
'Each person ate 2 cakes.\n\nSince Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, and he had 8 cakes initially, this means he divided the 8 cakes equally among his 4 friends. Therefore, each friend received 8 cakes / 4 friends = 2 cakes per friend.'
'Jessica cut 16 roses from her flower garden. This is because there were initially 3 roses in the vase, and now there are 19. Therefore, the difference between these two amounts, 19-3, gives us the number of roses Jessica cut, which is 16.'
'39 more children got off the bus than those that got on.\n\nDetails:\nInitially, there were 23 children on the bus. Then 24 more children got on the bus, making a total of 23 + 24 = 47 children on the bus. After some children got off, there were 8 children left on the bus. This means that 47 - 8 = 39 children got off the bus. Since 24 children got on the bus and 39 children got off the bus, 39 - 24 = 15 more children got off the bus than those that got on.'
'The book has a total of 125 pages. This is calculated by adding the number of pages in each chapter together: 66 pages (from the first chapter) + 35 pages (from the second chapter) + 24 pages (from the third chapter) = 125 pages.'
'There are 30 peaches in the basket. This total is obtained by adding the 7 red peaches, 15 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches together.'
'Paige and her mom had 6 flower beds. This is because if they planted 60 seeds altogether and they put 10 seeds in each flower bed, you would divide the total number of seeds (60) by the number of seeds per bed (10). So, 60 divided by 10 equals 6. Therefore, they had 6 flower beds.'
'The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu is 257, while the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 120. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number who suggested mashed potatoes. \n\nSo, 257 - 120 = 137\n\nTherefore, 137 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu than those who suggested adding bacon.'
'After 910 more boys joined the initial 214 boys, the total number of boys in the school now is 1124. This is obtained by adding the initial number of boys (214) to the number of boys who joined (910). So, 214 boys + 910 boys = 1124 boys.'
"The depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height, which means the water is 10 * 9 feet = 90 feet deep. To find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height, we subtract Dean's height from the total depth of the water. So, 90 feet - 9 feet = 81 feet. Therefore, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height."
'He already has 469 g of wax. \n\nThis is because if he needs 159 g more to reach a total of 628 g, then he must already have 628 g - 159 g = 469 g of wax.'
'Frank took 72 days to finish the 576-page book if he read 8 pages per day. This is because 576 divided by 8 equals 72.'
'There are 3 green peaches in the basket. \n\nDetails: \nThe total number of peaches in the basket is 16. Out of these, 13 are red. To find out how many are green, we subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches. \n\nSo, 16 (total peaches) - 13 (red peaches) = 3 (green peaches). Therefore, there are 3 green peaches in the basket.'
"First, we need to find out Dean's height. Since Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron and Ron stands at 14 feet, Dean's height is 14 feet - 8 feet = 6 feet.\n\nThe depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height. So, the depth of the water is 2 * 6 feet = 12 feet."
'First, we need to find the total number of pots in all the gardens. Since there are 544 pots in each garden and there are 10 gardens, we multiply 544 by 10 to get 5440 pots in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of flowers. Since each pot has 32 flowers, we multiply the total number of pots (5440) by the number of flowers in each pot (32).\n\n5440 pots * 32 flowers/pot = 174080 flowers\n\nSo, there are 174080 flowers in total.'
'Paige and her mom planted a total of 450 seeds. This is because they planted 10 seeds in each of the 45 flowerbeds, and 10 seeds times 45 flowerbeds equals 450 seeds.'

'Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday.'
'Carol needs to buy 5 packs of invitations. Each pack contains 2 invitations, so if she has 10 friends, she needs 5 packs (because 10 divided by 2 equals 5). This way, each of her friends will receive an invitation and no one will be left out.'
'The grocery store had 80 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda, which totals to 80 + 54 = <<80+54=134>>134 bottles of soda. \n\nThe grocery store had 36 apples. \n\nTherefore, the grocery store had 134 - 36 = <<134-36=98>>98 more bottles of soda than apples.'
'The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 14 + 37 = 51 inches.\nThe mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 51 - 16 = 35 inches.\nTherefore, the mouse jumped 35 - 14 = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.'
'Faye has 341 pencils and 297 crayons.\n\nDetails:\nIf Faye was placing her pencils into 11 rows with 31 pencils in each row, she would have 11*31 = 341 pencils.\nSimilarly, if she was placing her crayons into 11 rows with 27 crayons in each row, she would have 11*27 = 297 crayons.\nTherefore, Faye has 341 pencils + 297 crayons = 638 pencils and crayons altogether.'
"First, we need to find out the total number of students in the school. Since each classroom has 58 students and there are 87 classrooms, we multiply these two numbers together:\n\n58 students/classroom * 87 classrooms = 5046 students\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many buses are needed. Since each bus has 2 seats, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:\n\n5046 students / 2 seats/bus = 2523 buses\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the school needs 2523 buses for the field trip."
'Each necklace needed 0 beads. \n\nThis is because Emily only had 2 beads and she made 32 necklaces. It is impossible for each necklace to have more than 0 beads because she did not have enough beads. The question might be implying that she used parts of the beads for each necklace, but without that specific information, we can only conclude that each necklace had 0 beads.'
'Paige initially had 7 goldfish and 12 catfish, which totals to 19 fish. Now, she only has 15 left. Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared, presumably eaten by the stray cats, is 19 - 15 = 4 fish.'

'Paul has 37 books left with him. This is because he initially had 115 books and he sold 78 books in a garage sale. By subtracting the number of books he sold (78) from the initial number of books he had (115), we get the number of books he has left (37).'
'The machine made a total of 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today, which is 16 shirts in total. Given that the machine can make 8 shirts a minute, it would have taken 16 shirts ÷ 8 shirts/minute = 2 minutes for the machine to make all the shirts. So, the machine worked for 2 minutes in total.'
"Carol can invite 95 friends.\n\nHere's how:\nFirst, we need to find out how many invitations are in the packs she bought. Since each pack has 14 invitations and she bought 6 packs, we multiply 14 by 6. 14 * 6 = 84.\n\nThen, we add the 11 extra invitations she bought. 84 + 11 = 95.\n\nSo, Carol can invite 95 friends to her birthday party."
'The machine was working for 2 minutes to make 6 shirts. \n\nDetails: \nIf the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, then to make 6 shirts, it would need 6/3 = 2 minutes. This is because the rate of production is 3 shirts per minute, so if you divide the total number of shirts made (6) by the rate of production (3 shirts per minute), you get the total time it took to make those shirts (2 minutes).'
"Danny had 21 bottle caps at first.\n\nHere's how we can find out:\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many bottle caps Danny had after he found 63 at the park but before he threw away 51. Since he now has 33, we can add the 51 he threw away to this number to find out how many he had after finding the 63 but before throwing away the 51. So, 33 + 51 = 84.\n\nThen, to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we subtract the 63 he found at the park from this number. So, 84 - 63 = 21. \n\nSo, Danny had 21 bottle caps at first."
'The grocery store had 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda the store had, you subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the number of regular soda bottles. \n\nSo, 67 (regular soda) - 9 (diet soda) = 58\n\nTherefore, the grocery store had 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.'
'The total number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of those who stayed home and those who went to camp. So, 644997 kids who stayed home plus 893835 kids who went to camp gives a total of 1538832 kids in Lawrence county. The 78 kids from outside the county who attended the camp are not included in this total because the question asks specifically for the number of kids in Lawrence county.'
'Faye could make 6 rows. This is because 30 divided by 5 equals 6. Therefore, if she places 5 pencils in each row, she will have 6 rows of pencils.'
'Frank had 858 pieces of candy. This is because 26 bags multiplied by 33 pieces of candy per bag equals 858 pieces of candy.'
"The grocery store had 8 bottles of diet soda. \n\nHere's how we know: The total number of bottles in the grocery store was 17. Out of these, 9 were regular soda. To find out how many were diet soda, we subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the total number of bottles. So, 17 (total bottles) - 9 (regular soda bottles) = 8 (diet soda bottles). Therefore, the grocery store had 8 bottles of diet soda."
'Jake has 2 peaches because he has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 5 peaches. Jill has 3 peaches because Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 1 more peach than Jill.'
'Josh now has 18 marbles. He originally had 20 marbles, but he gave 2 to Jack, so he has 20-2=18 marbles left.'
'Jake has 8 peaches. This is because Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, and since Steven has 12 peaches, you subtract 4 from 12 to find out how many peaches Jake has.'
"The Razorback t-shirt shop made $8722 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game. \n\nHere's how you can calculate it:\n\nThe shop makes $98 off each t-shirt sold. So, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, you would multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the amount they make off each t-shirt.\n\nSo, 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt = $8722. \n\nTherefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8722 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game."
'Jack received a total of 14 emails in the day. This is calculated by adding the number of emails he received in the morning (6 emails), afternoon (3 emails), and evening (5 emails).'
'Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches.\nJake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 peaches.\nTherefore, Jake has 100 - 87 = 13 more peaches than Jill.'
"John needs 229 nails for the house wall.\n\nHere's how:\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks of wood. Since each large plank needs 17 nails and there are 13 large planks, multiply 17 by 13 to get 221 nails.\n\nThen, add the 8 additional nails needed for the smaller planks. \n\nSo, 221 nails for the large planks plus 8 nails for the smaller planks equals 229 nails in total. Therefore, John needs 229 nails for the house wall."
'The grocery store had 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda. This is calculated by subtracting the number of diet soda bottles (54) from the number of regular soda bottles (83).'
'The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu is 330, while the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 269. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. \n\nSo, 330 (students who suggested mashed potatoes) - 269 (students who suggested bacon) = 61.\n\nTherefore, 61 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu than those that suggested adding bacon.'
"Brenda's mother prepared a total of 420 cookies. This is because if each of the 14 people received 30 cookies, you would multiply the number of people (14) by the number of cookies each person received (30) to get the total number of cookies prepared. So, 14 people times 30 cookies equals 420 cookies."
'Dave initially had 15 apps and added 71 more, so he had a total of 15 + 71 = 86 apps on his phone. \n\nIf he ended up with 14 apps, this means he deleted 86 - 14 = 72 apps. \n\nTherefore, Dave deleted 72 - 71 = 1 more app than he added.'
'Kelly will have 42 Nintendo games left if she gives away 64 out of her 106 games. This is calculated by subtracting the number of games she gives away (64) from the total number she originally had (106).'
"Matthew initially had 15 crackers and he was left with 10 after giving some to his friends. This means he gave away 15 - 10 = 5 crackers. \n\nSince he gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 5 friends, each friend received 5 / 5 = 1 cracker. \n\nSo, each of Matthew's friends ate 1 cracker."

'The grocery store had 2 bottles of diet soda. This is because the total number of bottles in the store was 30, and out of these, 28 were regular soda. Therefore, the remaining bottles, which are diet soda, can be found by subtracting the number of regular soda bottles from the total number of bottles. That is, 30 - 28 = 2.'
'The Ferris wheel can hold 28 people on small seats. This is because there are 2 small seats and each small seat can hold 14 people. So, 2 small seats * 14 people per small seat = 28 people.'
'Debby would have enough soda bottles to last for 40 days. This is because if she drinks 9 soda bottles a day and she has 360 soda bottles, you would divide 360 by 9 to find out how many days the soda bottles would last. 360 divided by 9 equals 40. Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 40 days.'

"The question seems to have a discrepancy in the numbers given. If there were initially 45 bird families near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away, it implies that there were more bird families that flew away than there were initially. \n\nHowever, if we proceed with the numbers given, the difference between the bird families that flew away and those that stayed would be 86 - 45 = 41 bird families. This would mean that 41 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind near the mountain. \n\nBut again, this doesn't make sense with the initial information given. It might be a mistake in the question. The number of bird families that flew away should be less than or equal to the number of bird families that were initially near the mountain."

'Bryan has 19 bookshelves. This is because if each bookshelf contains 2 books, and Bryan has a total of 38 books, then dividing the total number of books (38) by the number of books each bookshelf can hold (2) gives the total number of bookshelves. So, 38 divided by 2 equals 19. Therefore, Bryan has 19 bookshelves.'
"Jessica cut 13 roses from her flower garden. \n\nHere's how we know: \n\nJessica initially had 7 roses in the vase. After cutting some roses from her garden, she now has 20 roses in the vase. The difference between the number of roses she has now and the number she initially had is the number of roses she cut from her garden. \n\nSo, we subtract the initial number of roses in the vase from the final number of roses in the vase: \n\n20 roses (final number in vase) - 7 roses (initial number in vase) = 13 roses (number cut from garden). \n\nSo, Jessica cut 13 roses from her flower garden."
'Luke played 26 rounds of the trivia game. This is because if he gained 3 points in each round and scored a total of 78 points, you would divide the total points (78) by the points gained per round (3) to find the number of rounds played. So, 78 divided by 3 equals 26.'
"The baker bought 63 more cakes than he sold. \n\nHere's how you can calculate it: \n\nThe baker sold 91 cakes and bought 154 cakes. To find out how many more cakes he bought than sold, you subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he bought. \n\nSo, 154 (cakes bought) - 91 (cakes sold) = 63 (more cakes bought than sold)."
'They harvest 11 more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges per day. This is calculated by subtracting the number of sacks of ripe oranges (60) from the number of sacks of unripe oranges (71).'
'The total number of animals hiding in the cage is the sum of the number of snakes and alligators hiding, which is 24 + 51 = 75 animals.\n\nIf the total number of animals in the cage is 79, then the number of animals not hiding is the total number of animals minus the number of animals hiding, which is 79 - 75 = 4 animals.\n\nTherefore, there were 4 animals not hiding in the cage.'
'Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park. This is because he originally had 21 bottle caps and now has 53. If you subtract 21 from 53, you get 32. Therefore, Danny must have found 32 bottle caps at the park to add to his original collection of 21 to now have a total of 53 bottle caps.'
'Frank read 0.0030120481927710845 chapters per day.\n\nDetails:\nThe total number of chapters in the book is 2. Frank took 664 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, to find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we divide the total number of chapters by the total number of days.\n\nSo, 2 chapters ÷ 664 days = 0.0030120481927710845 chapters per day. \n\nThis means that Frank did not read a full chapter each day, but rather a small fraction of a chapter.'
"The question seems to have a logical inconsistency. If there were initially 2 roses in the vase, Jessica couldn't have thrown away 4 roses from the vase. However, if we assume that Jessica did throw away 4 roses, she would have had to replace those 4 roses plus add an additional 21 roses to have a total of 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, Jessica would have had to cut 25 roses from her garden."
'Rachel had to complete a total of 16 pages of reading and biology homework. This is because she had 10 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework. Adding these together gives us 16 pages.'
'After adding 4 more books, Jerry had a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 books on his shelf.\n\nJerry had 7 action figures on his shelf, so he had 7 - 6 = <<7-6=1>>1 more action figure than books on his shelf.'

"Initially, Marco and his dad together collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. After Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, the total weight of the strawberries they had increased to 22 + 30 = 52 pounds.\n\nIf Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds, then the weight of his dad's strawberries would be the total weight of the strawberries they had minus the weight of Marco's strawberries. \n\nSo, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 52 - 36 = 16 pounds."
'There are 13 green peaches in the basket.\n\nDetails: \nThe problem states that there are 3 red peaches in the basket. It also states that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. To find out how many green peaches there are, you simply add the number of red peaches (3) to the additional green peaches (10). So, 3 red peaches + 10 more green peaches = 13 green peaches. Therefore, there are 13 green peaches in the basket.'
'The question seems to have a contradiction. If Haley initially had 3 trees and 13 trees died after the typhoon, it implies that there were more trees than initially stated or some trees survived the typhoon. \n\nAssuming that all 3 trees died in the typhoon and no new trees were grown, then no trees survived. Therefore, 13-3 = 10 more trees died than those that survived. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the 13 trees include the initial 3 trees and the rest grew and died during the typhoon, then all 3 initial trees died and no trees survived. Therefore, 13-0 = 13 more trees died than those that survived. \n\nThe question needs to provide more clear information about the number of trees before and after the typhoon.'
'Josh lost 5 marbles. This is calculated by subtracting the number of marbles he has now (4) from the number of marbles he had originally (9).'
'They have 126 chairs in total because 14 times 9 equals 126. If each set of table includes one table, then they have 9 tables. Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables because 126 minus 9 equals 117.'
'They harvest 1848 oranges per day. This is calculated by multiplying the number of sacks they harvest per day (66) by the number of oranges each sack contains (28). So, 66 sacks * 28 oranges/sack = 1848 oranges.'

'Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to her cake recipe. This is because the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar in total and she has already added 2 cups. By subtracting the 2 cups she has already added from the total 13 cups needed, we find that she still needs to add 11 cups of sugar.'
'There were 47 more bird families that flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa. This is because 94 bird families flew to Asia and 47 bird families flew to Africa. The difference between these two numbers is 47.'
"Steven has 27 more peaches than Jill.\n\nDetails:\n- Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.\n- Since Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches, so there must be a mistake in the problem. If we assume that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Jill, then Jill has 7 + 18 = 25 peaches.\n- Therefore, Steven has 16 - 25 = -9 fewer peaches than Jill. But the question asks how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, so the answer is 0, because Steven doesn't have more peaches than Jill, he has fewer.\n\nHowever, if we stick to the original problem and assume that Jill has 0 peaches (since she can't have a negative number), then Steven has 16 - 0 = 16 more peaches than Jill. But this doesn't take into account the information that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so it's not a satisfactory solution.\n\nIn conclusion, there seems to be a mistake in the problem, because it's not possible for Jake to have both 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill if Steven has 16 peaches."
'Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David. This is found by subtracting the number of push-ups David did (44) from the number of push-ups Zachary did (51).'

However, if we assume that Jessica did throw away 34 roses in total (including some that were not in the vase), then she must have cut and added 28 roses from her garden to the vase (since there are now 15 roses in the vase and she started with 21). Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden (34 thrown away - 28 cut = 6).'
'After Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park, he had a total of 2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>>5 balloons.\n\nJake had 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1 more balloon than Allan.'
'They harvest a total of 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day, which equals to 80 sacks of oranges per day (28+52=80). \n\nIf they continue this for 26 days, they will have harvested a total of 2080 sacks of oranges (80*26=2080). \n\nSo, after 26 days of harvest, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges.'
'Adam has 2 apples.\n\nIf together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples, and "he" (presumably a third person) has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined, that means "he" has 10 apples (6 + 4). \n\nHowever, the question asks how many apples Adam has. To find this, we need to subtract Jackie\'s apples from the total they have together. Since we don\'t have information on how many apples Jackie has, we can\'t definitively say how many apples Adam has. \n\nBut if we assume that Adam and Jackie have an equal number of apples, then Adam would have 3 apples. \n\nIf we assume that "he" refers back to Adam (which is grammatically incorrect but could be a trick of the question), then Adam would have 2 apples. This is because if Adam had 4 more apples than the combined total, he would have 10 apples, which would mean Jackie would have -4 apples. Since it\'s impossible to have negative apples, the only solution is that Adam has 2 apples and Jackie has 4. \n\nSo, based on the information given and depending on interpretation, Adam could have 2 or 3 apples.'
'After the typhoon, Haley had 11 - 2 = <<11-2=9>>9 trees left in her backyard.\n\nTherefore, 9 - 2 = <<9-2=7>>7 more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.'

"Matthew gave 7 crackers to his friends. \n\nHere's how we know: \n\nMatthew started with 24 crackers and after giving some to his friends, he had 17 left. This means he gave away 24 - 17 = 7 crackers. Since he gave an equal number to each of his 3 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers he gave away by the number of friends. So, 7 crackers / 3 friends = approximately 2.33 crackers per friend. However, since you can't really give a third of a cracker, we can assume that he gave 2 crackers to two friends and 3 crackers to one friend."
'The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. This means the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches, which is not possible. There seems to be a mistake in the problem. If we assume that the frog jumped 25 inches less than the grasshopper, then the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches, which is still not possible. \n\nIf we assume that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches more than the frog, then the frog jumped 21 - 25 = -4 inches, which is still not possible. \n\nIf we assume that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches and the frog jumped 21 inches, then the mouse jumped 21 - 16 = 5 inches. In this case, the grasshopper jumped 25 - 5 = 20 inches farther than the mouse. \n\nHowever, based on the information given in the problem, it is not possible to determine how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse.'
