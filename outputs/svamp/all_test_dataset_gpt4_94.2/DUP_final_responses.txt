'To find out how many children got off the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children left on the bus from the total number of children that were originally on the bus. \n\nSo, 43 (total number of children on the bus) - 21 (number of children left on the bus) = 22 children.\n\nTherefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.'
'Initially, there were 28 children on the bus. Then 82 children got on the bus, making a total of 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus. However, after some children got off, there were only 30 children left on the bus. This means that 110 - 30 = 80 children must have gotten off the bus.\n\nTherefore, the number of children who got on the bus (82) minus the number who got off (80) is 82 - 80 = 2. So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.'
'Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet. She then collected 49 dollars from the atm, making her total money 52 dollars (3 dollars + 49 dollars). After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left. This means she spent 3 dollars at the supermarket (52 dollars - 49 dollars).\n\nTherefore, Olivia collected 46 dollars more at the atm than she spent at the supermarket (49 dollars - 3 dollars).'
'Jerry initially had 3 action figures on his shelf before he added 7 more. This is because if he now has 10 action figures and he added 7, then he must have had 10 - 7 = 3 action figures to start with.'
'Paco ate 9 more cookies than those he gave to his friend. \n\nDetails: \nPaco ate 18 cookies and gave 9 cookies to his friend. To find out how many more cookies Paco ate than those he gave to his friend, we subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate. \n\nSo, 18 (cookies eaten) - 9 (cookies given) = 9 more cookies eaten.'
'Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour to her cake recipe. This is because the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour in total and she has already added 6 cups. By subtracting the 6 cups she has already added from the total 10 cups required, we find that she still needs to add 4 more cups.'
'The waiter initially had 21 customers. This is because after 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers. Therefore, before the 9 customers left, he must have had 9 customers + 12 customers = 21 customers.'

'They have 143 chairs in the backyard. This is because each set of tables comes with 13 chairs, and they have 11 sets. So, you multiply the number of sets (11) by the number of chairs per set (13) to get the total number of chairs, which is 143.'
'There are 692 girls in the school and 458 more girls than boys. This means there are 692 - 458 = 234 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 692 girls + 234 boys = 926 pupils.'
"Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who stands at 13 feet. Therefore, Dean is 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet tall. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, so the water is 15 times * 17 feet = 255 feet deep."
'After 4 more birds and 8 more storks joined the initial 6 birds, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence. This is because storks are also a type of bird. So, the total number of birds is the sum of the initial birds, the additional birds, and the storks (6+4+8=18).'
"After Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries, the total weight of the strawberries they had was 36 - 8 = 28 pounds. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds, his dad's strawberries weighed 28 - 12 = 16 pounds."
'There are 469 boys in the school.\n\nDetails:\nAccording to the information given, there are 697 girls in the school and there are 228 more girls than boys.

'The total number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items is the sum of the students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and those who suggested adding bacon to the menu. \n\nSo, the total number of students who participated is 450 (students who suggested mashed potatoes) + 38 (students who suggested bacon) = 488 students. \n\nTherefore, 488 students participated in the suggestion of new food items.'
"Matthew could only distribute the same number of crackers and cakes to each friend if he had an equal number of each. Since he had fewer crackers (13) than cakes (15), he could only distribute 13 crackers and 13 cakes equally among his friends.\n\nSo, each of Matthew's 28 friends ate 13/28 crackers and 13/28 cakes. However, since it's not possible to divide a single cracker or cake into 28 parts, we can say that not every friend received a cracker or a cake. \n\nIn other words, Matthew could not distribute the crackers and cakes equally among all his friends."
'The grocery store had 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda. To find the total number of regular and diet soda bottles, you add the two amounts together. \n\n49 (regular soda) + 40 (diet soda) = 89 bottles\n\nSo, the grocery store had 89 bottles of regular and diet soda altogether.'
"Each candy bar cost $2. \n\nHere's how we know: Dan spent a total of $4 on 2 candy bars. Since each candy bar costs the same amount, we can find the cost of each by dividing the total cost by the number of candy bars. So, $4 รท 2 = $2. Therefore, each candy bar cost $2."

'To find out how many kids stayed home during summer break, we need to subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.\n\nSo, 828521 (total kids) - 800059 (kids who went to camp) = 28462 kids.\n\nTherefore, 28462 kids from Lawrence county stayed home during summer break.'
'The total number of flowers in all the pots is calculated by multiplying the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot. \n\nSo, 141 pots * 71 flowers/pot = 10,011 flowers. \n\nTherefore, there are 10,011 flowers in all the pots.'
'Allan initially had 2 balloons and then bought 3 more at the park, so he had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Jake had 4 balloons. Therefore, Allan had 5 - 4 = 1 balloon more than Jake in the park after Allan bought 3 more balloons.'
'The chef had 58 apples and used 35 for making pies. To find out how many apples remained, we subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples. \n\nSo, 58 - 35 = 23\n\nTherefore, the chef had 23 apples remaining after making the pies.'
'Each bag has 2 cookies. \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the total number of cookies (52) by the total number of bags (26). So, 52 cookies / 26 bags = 2 cookies per bag.'
"After 49 days of harvest, they will have 1862 sacks of oranges. \n\nHere's how you calculate it: \n\nThey harvest 38 sacks per day. So, over the course of 49 days, they would have harvested a total of 38 sacks/day * 49 days = 1862 sacks. \n\nThe number of oranges in each sack does not affect the total number of sacks, so it is not necessary to consider it in this calculation."
'Jessica cut 4 orchids from her flower garden. This is because there were originally 3 orchids in the vase and now there are 7. The difference between these two amounts (7-3) is 4, which is the number of orchids Jessica must have cut and added to the vase.'
'Jack received 1 more email in the afternoon than in the evening.'
'Faye has a total of 84 pencils. This is because if each pack contains 14 pencils, and she has 6 packs, you would multiply 14 by 6 to get the total number of pencils. So, 14 pencils/pack * 6 packs = 84 pencils.'
"The farmer had 160 tomatoes and he picked 56 of them yesterday. So, to find out how many tomatoes he had left after yesterday's picking, we subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had. \n\nSo, 160 (total tomatoes) - 56 (picked tomatoes) = 104 tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, the farmer had 104 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking."
'To find out how many pots there are, you need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each pot. \n\nSo, 400 flowers รท 40 flowers/pot = 10 pots\n\nTherefore, there are 10 pots in total.'
'In the morning, 15 campers went rowing. By the end of the day, a total of 32 campers had gone rowing. To find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing that day.\n\nSo, 32 (total campers) - 15 (morning campers) = 17 campers.\n\nTherefore, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.'
'There were 10 more students who suggested adding bacon to the menu than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes.'
'Doug initially had 25 marbles. \n\nSince Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, and Ed had 27 marbles, that means Doug had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles after he lost 3 at the playground. Therefore, before Doug lost his marbles, he must have had 22 + 3 = 25 marbles.'
'Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework. \n\nThis is because, according to the problem, Rachel had 7 pages of math homework, which is 4 pages more than her reading homework. Therefore, to find out how many pages of reading homework she had, we subtract 4 from 7 (the total number of math pages). This gives us 3 pages of reading homework.'
'Helen baked a total of 19 + 237 = <<19+237=256>>256 chocolate chip cookies.\nTherefore, Helen baked 256 - 231 = <<256-231=25>>25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.'
'Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday. This is because if she found 4 more bags the next day and had a total of 8 bags, then she must have started with 4 bags (8 total - 4 found = 4 original).'
"Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park. \n\nHere's how you can find the answer: \n\nFirst, you need to know how many bottle caps Danny threw away and how many he found. According to the problem, Danny found 30 bottle caps at the park and threw away 63. \n\nTo find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, you subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the number he threw away. \n\nSo, 63 (the number of bottle caps thrown away) - 30 (the number of bottle caps found) = 33. \n\nTherefore, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park."
'Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar because she has already added 10 cups and the recipe calls for 12 cups. The recipe also calls for 14 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 14 cups of flour. \n\nSo, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than she does sugar because 14 cups of flour minus 2 cups of sugar equals 12 cups.'
'Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to have a total of 140 games. This is because 140 (the total number of games she wants) minus 22 (the number of games she currently has) equals 118.'

"You have read 1 more book than the number of movies you have watched in the 'crazy silly school' series."
'Emily used a total of 308 beads to make 11 necklaces. This is because for each necklace, she used 28 beads. So, if you multiply the number of necklaces (11) by the number of beads per necklace (28), you get the total number of beads used (308).'
"The farmer still has all 175 tomatoes because the question does not mention that he picked any tomatoes. However, he picked 172 out of his 77 potatoes. But it's impossible to pick 172 potatoes if he only had 77. There seems to be a mistake in the question. If we assume that he picked 72 potatoes instead, he would have 5 potatoes left. So, the farmer would have 175 tomatoes and 5 potatoes left."
'Fred and Jason earned a total of 8 dollars over the weekend. Fred earned 4 dollars by washing cars (115-111=4) and Jason earned 4 dollars by delivering newspapers (44-40=4).'

'The grocery store had 80 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda, which totals to 80 + 54 = <<80+54=134>>134 bottles of soda. \n\nThe grocery store had 36 apples. \n\nTherefore, the grocery store had 134 - 36 = <<134-36=98>>98 more bottles of soda than apples.'
'The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 14 + 37 = 51 inches.\nThe mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 51 - 16 = 35 inches.\nTherefore, the mouse jumped 35 - 14 = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.'
'Faye has 341 pencils and 297 crayons.\n\nDetails:\nIf Faye was placing her pencils into 11 rows with 31 pencils in each row, she would have 11*31 = 341 pencils.\nSimilarly, if she was placing her crayons into 11 rows with 27 crayons in each row, she would have 11*27 = 297 crayons.\nTherefore, Faye has 341 pencils + 297 crayons = 638 pencils and crayons altogether.'
"First, we need to find out the total number of students in the school. Since each classroom has 58 students and there are 87 classrooms, we multiply these two numbers together:\n\n58 students/classroom * 87 classrooms = 5046 students\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many buses are needed. Since each bus has 2 seats, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:\n\n5046 students / 2 seats/bus = 2523 buses\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the school needs 2523 buses for the field trip."
'Each necklace needed 0 beads. \n\nThis is because Emily only had 2 beads and she made 32 necklaces. It is impossible for each necklace to have more than 0 beads because she did not have enough beads. The question might be implying that she used parts of the beads for each necklace, but without that specific information, we can only conclude that each necklace had 0 beads.'

Since each pack has 14 invitations and she bought 6 packs, we multiply 14 by 6. 14 * 6 = 84.\n\nThen, we add the 11 extra invitations she bought. 84 + 11 = 95.\n\nSo, Carol can invite 95 friends to her birthday party."
'The machine was working for 2 minutes to make 6 shirts. \n\nDetails: \nIf the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, then to make 6 shirts, it would need 6/3 = 2 minutes. This is because the rate of production is 3 shirts per minute, so if you divide the total number of shirts made (6) by the rate of production (3 shirts per minute), you get the total time it took to make those shirts (2 minutes).'
"Danny had 21 bottle caps at first.\n\nHere's how we can find out:\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many bottle caps Danny had after he found 63 at the park but before he threw away 51. Since he now has 33, we can add the 51 he threw away to this number to find out how many he had after finding the 63 but before throwing away the 51. So, 33 + 51 = 84.\n\nThen, to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we subtract the 63 he found at the park from this number. So, 84 - 63 = 21. \n\nSo, Danny had 21 bottle caps at first."
'The grocery store had 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda the store had, you subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the number of regular soda bottles. \n\nSo, 67 (regular soda) - 9 (diet soda) = 58\n\nTherefore, the grocery store had 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.'
'The total number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of those who stayed home and those who went to camp. So, 644997 kids who stayed home plus 893835 kids who went to camp gives a total of 1538832 kids in Lawrence county. The 78 kids from outside the county who attended the camp are not included in this total because the question asks specifically for the number of kids in Lawrence county.'

Therefore, the grocery store had 8 bottles of diet soda."
'Jake has 2 peaches because he has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 5 peaches. Jill has 3 peaches because Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 1 more peach than Jill.'
'Josh now has 18 marbles. He originally had 20 marbles, but he gave 2 to Jack, so he has 20-2=18 marbles left.'
'Jake has 8 peaches. This is because Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, and since Steven has 12 peaches, you subtract 4 from 12 to find out how many peaches Jake has.'
"The Razorback t-shirt shop made $8722 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game. \n\nHere's how you can calculate it:\n\nThe shop makes $98 off each t-shirt sold. So, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, you would multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the amount they make off each t-shirt.\n\nSo, 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt = $8722. \n\nTherefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8722 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game."

"The question seems to have a discrepancy in the numbers given. If there were initially 45 bird families near the mountain and 86 bird families flew away, it implies that there were more bird families that flew away than there were initially. \n\nHowever, if we proceed with the numbers given, the difference between the bird families that flew away and those that stayed would be 86 - 45 = 41 bird families. This would mean that 41 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind near the mountain. \n\nBut again, this doesn't make sense with the initial information given. It might be a mistake in the question. The number of bird families that flew away should be less than or equal to the number of bird families that were initially near the mountain."

"The question seems to have a logical inconsistency. If there were initially 2 roses in the vase, Jessica couldn't have thrown away 4 roses from the vase. However, if we assume that Jessica did throw away 4 roses, she would have had to replace those 4 roses plus add an additional 21 roses to have a total of 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, Jessica would have had to cut 25 roses from her garden."
'Rachel had to complete a total of 16 pages of reading and biology homework. This is because she had 10 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework. Adding these together gives us 16 pages.'
'After adding 4 more books, Jerry had a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 books on his shelf.\n\nJerry had 7 action figures on his shelf, so he had 7 - 6 = <<7-6=1>>1 more action figure than books on his shelf.'

"Initially, Marco and his dad together collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. After Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, the total weight of the strawberries they had increased to 22 + 30 = 52 pounds.\n\nIf Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds, then the weight of his dad's strawberries would be the total weight of the strawberries they had minus the weight of Marco's strawberries. \n\nSo, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 52 - 36 = 16 pounds."
'There are 13 green peaches in the basket.\n\nDetails: \nThe problem states that there are 3 red peaches in the basket. It also states that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. To find out how many green peaches there are, you simply add the number of red peaches (3) to the additional green peaches (10). So, 3 red peaches + 10 more green peaches = 13 green peaches. Therefore, there are 13 green peaches in the basket.'
'The question seems to have a contradiction. If Haley initially had 3 trees and 13 trees died after the typhoon, it implies that there were more trees than initially stated or some trees survived the typhoon. \n\nAssuming that all 3 trees died in the typhoon and no new trees were grown, then no trees survived. Therefore, 13-3 = 10 more trees died than those that survived. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the 13 trees include the initial 3 trees and the rest grew and died during the typhoon, then all 3 initial trees died and no trees survived. Therefore, 13-0 = 13 more trees died than those that survived. \n\nThe question needs to provide more clear information about the number of trees before and after the typhoon.'
'Josh lost 5 marbles. This is calculated by subtracting the number of marbles he has now (4) from the number of marbles he had originally (9).'
'They have 126 chairs in total because 14 times 9 equals 126. If each set of table includes one table, then they have 9 tables. Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables because 126 minus 9 equals 117.'
'They harvest 1848 oranges per day. This is calculated by multiplying the number of sacks they harvest per day (66) by the number of oranges each sack contains (28). So, 66 sacks * 28 oranges/sack = 1848 oranges.'

'Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to her cake recipe. This is because the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar in total and she has already added 2 cups. By subtracting the 2 cups she has already added from the total 13 cups needed, we find that she still needs to add 11 cups of sugar.'
'There were 47 more bird families that flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa. This is because 94 bird families flew to Asia and 47 bird families flew to Africa. The difference between these two numbers is 47.'
"Steven has 27 more peaches than Jill.\n\nDetails:\n- Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.\n- Since Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches, so there must be a mistake in the problem. If we assume that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Jill, then Jill has 7 + 18 = 25 peaches.\n- Therefore, Steven has 16 - 25 = -9 fewer peaches than Jill. But the question asks how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, so the answer is 0, because Steven doesn't have more peaches than Jill, he has fewer.\n\nHowever, if we stick to the original problem and assume that Jill has 0 peaches (since she can't have a negative number), then Steven has 16 - 0 = 16 more peaches than Jill. But this doesn't take into account the information that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so it's not a satisfactory solution.\n\nIn conclusion, there seems to be a mistake in the problem, because it's not possible for Jake to have both 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill if Steven has 16 peaches."

'Jessica could not have thrown away 34 roses from the vase if there were only 21 roses in the vase to begin with. This seems to be a mistake in the problem. However, if we assume that Jessica did throw away 34 roses in total (including some that were not in the vase), then she must have cut and added 28 roses from her garden to the vase (since there are now 15 roses in the vase and she started with 21). Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden (34 thrown away - 28 cut = 6).'
'After Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park, he had a total of 2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>>5 balloons.\n\nJake had 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1 more balloon than Allan.'
'They harvest a total of 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day, which equals to 80 sacks of oranges per day (28+52=80). \n\nIf they continue this for 26 days, they will have harvested a total of 2080 sacks of oranges (80*26=2080). \n\nSo, after 26 days of harvest, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges.'
'Adam has 2 apples.\n\nIf together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples, and "he" (presumably a third person) has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined, that means "he" has 10 apples (6 + 4). \n\nHowever, the question asks how many apples Adam has. To find this, we need to subtract Jackie\'s apples from the total they have together. Since we don\'t have information on how many apples Jackie has, we can\'t definitively say how many apples Adam has. \n\nBut if we assume that Adam and Jackie have an equal number of apples, then Adam would have 3 apples. \n\nIf we assume that "he" refers back to Adam (which is grammatically incorrect but could be a trick of the question), then Adam would have 2 apples. This is because if Adam had 4 more apples than the combined total, he would have 10 apples, which would mean Jackie would have -4 apples. Since it\'s impossible to have negative apples, the only solution is that Adam has 2 apples and Jackie has 4. \n\nSo, based on the information given and depending on interpretation, Adam could have 2 or 3 apples.'
