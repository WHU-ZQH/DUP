Religion often involves cultural, historical, and societal contexts that influence its teachings and practices, making it harder to separate religious aspects from other factors.\n6. The diversity of religious experiences and perspectives across different cultures and time periods further contributes to the difficulty in understanding religion universally.\n7.
