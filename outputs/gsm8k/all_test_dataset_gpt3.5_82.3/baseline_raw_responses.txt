"Let's assume the regular price of popcorn is P dollars.\n\nIf you buy a movie ticket for $12 and purchase one popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost would be $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.\n\nIf you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying a movie ticket and purchasing popcorn and a soda at regular price is $15 + P - $2 = $13 + P.\n\nSince the super ticket costs $20 and includes one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.\n\nSince you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:\n\n$21 - $2 = $13 + P\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$19 = $13 + P\n\nSubtracting $13 from both sides, we get:\n\n$6 = P\n\nTherefore, the regular price of popcorn is $6."

"Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was x%.\n\nAfter charging her friends' phones for 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the power bank lost 5 * 9% = 45% of its total capacity.\n\nTherefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours of charging her friends' phones is x% - 45% = (x - 45)%.\n\nAfter that, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, it lost 3 * 7% = 21% of its total capacity.\n\nTherefore, the charge remaining after 3 hours of losing 7% each hour is (x - 45)% - 21% = (x - 66)%.\n\nFinally, the charge remaining after all these events is 28%, so we have the equation:\n\n(x - 66)% = 28%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx - 66 = 0.28\n\nx = 0.28 + 66\n\nx = 66.28\n\nTherefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 66.28%."
