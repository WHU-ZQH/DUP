Since Marilyn\'s record sold 10 times as many copies, we can represent Marilyn\'s record sales as "10x".\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we get:\n10x + x = 88,000\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n11x = 88,000\n\nTo find the value of x (Harald\'s record sales), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\nx = 88,000 / 11\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\nx = 8,000\n\nTherefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.'

Rolling two even numbers in a row requires rolling either 2 and 4 or 4 and 6.\n5. The probability of rolling a 2 followed by a 4 is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n6. The probability of rolling a 4 followed by a 6 is also 1/36.\n7. The total probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/36 + 1/36 = 2/36 or 1/18.\n8. To calculate the percentage difference, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: (1/2) - (1/18) = 8/18 or 4/9.\n9. The percentage difference is (4/9) * 100 = 44.44%.\n10. Therefore, it is 44.44% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.'
