"To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost, annual lemon sales, and annual expenses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons. Carlos can sell 7 lemons per year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. So the annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual expenses. Carlos needs to spend $3 per year to water and feed the tree.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net profit (revenue - expenses) for each year. The net profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.\n\nTo recoup the initial cost of $90, Carlos needs to earn $90 in net profit. Since the net profit per year is $7.5, it will take $90 / $7.5 = 12 years to recoup the initial cost.\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree after considering the initial cost, annual lemon sales, and annual expenses."

'To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first calculate the total time she has spent walking so far. \n\nMarissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so she has already spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours walking. \n\nSince Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: \n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time \n\nWe know the average speed is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the total time: \n\nTotal time = Total distance / Average speed \n\nTotal time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours \n\nSo far, Marissa has spent 2 hours walking, which means she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance. \n\nThe remaining distance she needs to walk is 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles. \n\nTo find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time \n\nSpeed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour \n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour in order to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.'
'To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, and then combine them to find the total amount of water in the mixture.\n\n1. Orange drink:\nWe are given that there are 10 liters of orange drink, and it is two-thirds water. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we multiply the total volume (10 liters) by the fraction of water (2/3):\nWater in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters\n\n2. Pineapple drink:\nWe are given that there are 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we multiply the total volume (15 liters) by the fraction of water (3/5):\nWater in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters\n\n3. Spillage:\nOne liter of the orange drink is spilled, so we subtract this amount from the total water in the orange drink:\nWater spilled = 1 liter\n\n4. Total water in the mixture:\nTo find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we add the water in the orange drink, water in the pineapple drink, and subtract the spilled water:\nTotal water = (20/3 liters + 9 liters) - 1 liter = 20/3 + 9 - 1 = 29/3 liters\n\nTherefore, there are 29/3 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture.'

"To find the maximum distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to consider the combined distances that Polly can throw the javelin.\n\nWithout the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.\n\nSince the dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet, Polly needs to stand outside this range to hit the dragon. Therefore, the maximum distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.\n\nSo, Polly can stand up to 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories you can consume and then convert it into grams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the remaining calories you can consume:\nDaily calorie target - Consumed calories = Remaining calories\n2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of servings you can have:\nRemaining calories ÷ Calories per serving = Number of servings\n200 calories ÷ 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings\n\nSince a bag of chips has 5 servings, you can eat 0.8 servings. \n\nTo convert servings into grams, we need to know the weight of one serving. Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving weighs 300g ÷ 5 = 60g.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the grams of chips you can eat:\nNumber of servings × Weight per serving = Grams of chips\n0.8 servings × 60g per serving = 48 grams of chips\n\nTherefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."

'The first time the alarm went off, it rang four times. Since the alarm is set to ring three times a day, this means it rang an additional three times after the initial four, for a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 times.\n\nThe second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang for four times, the second time it rang for 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 times.\n\nThe third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang for 12 times, the third time it rang for 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times.\n\nTherefore, the alarm rang a total of 7 + 12 + 6 = <<7+12+6=25>>25 times throughout the day.'
"Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. Since she has been working for the company for 5 years, she is eligible for the salary increase. \n\nThe salary increase is 10% of the initial salary every year. So, after 5 years, Sylvie's salary would have increased by 10% * 5 = 50% of her initial salary.\n\nTo calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for those three years.\n\nThe salary increase for each year is 10% of the initial salary, which is 10% * $600 = $60.\n\nSo, after three more years of service, Sylvie's salary would have increased by 3 * $60 = $180.\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service would be $600 + $180 = $780."

So Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.\n\nNow we can set up the equation 50y = 300.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 50, we get y = 6. So there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph at the zoo."
"To calculate the total profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to determine the selling price of each type of board and then subtract the cost price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the prices for lumber have gone up 50%, the selling price will be 100% + 50% = 150% of the cost price.\nThe selling price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 150% = $15.\n\nNext, let's calculate the selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. Using the same logic, the selling price will be 100% + 50% = 150% of the cost price.\nThe selling price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 150% = $24.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit for each type of board.\n\nFor the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:\nProfit per board = Selling price - Cost price = $15 - $10 = $5\nTotal profit for ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $5 * 10 = $50\n\nFor the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:\nProfit per board = Selling price - Cost price = $24 - $16 = $8\nTotal profit for five 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $8 * 5 = $40\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total profit Sasha makes from selling all her leftover lumber.\nTotal profit = Profit from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Profit from 4 x 4 x 10 boards\nTotal profit = $50 + $40 = $90\n\nTherefore, Sasha makes a total profit of $90 from selling her leftover lumber."

So the total number of vehicles from these containers is 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles.\n\nIf the total number of vehicles at the port became 30, then the additional containers brought in on the second day must have contained 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles.\n\nSince each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.'
"Let's start by finding Adrien's salary four years ago, which was $40000. Adrien's salary increased by 40% in four years, so his current salary is $40000 + ($40000 * 40%) = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.\n\nSince Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago by dividing Adrien's salary four years ago by 1.3 (100% + 30% = 130% = 1.3). So Lylah's salary four years ago was $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23.\n\nNow, let's calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his salary four years later is $56000 + ($56000 * 40%) = $56000 + $22400 = $78400.\n\nSince Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later by dividing Adrien's salary four years later by 1.3. So Lylah's salary four years later is $78400 / 1.3 = $60307.69.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the combined total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later. The total salary is Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later = $78400 + $60307.69 = $138707.69.\n\nTherefore, the combined total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $138707.69."

"Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Dave ate fourteen french fries before the seagull stole the pack.\n2. The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. So the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 french fries.\n3. After the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 french fries left.\n4. Three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.\n5. After the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 french fries left. (Note: Negative fries don't make sense, so this means there were no fries left at this point.)\n6. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Since there were no fries left, the raccoon stole 2/3 * 0 = 0 fries.\n7. After the raccoon stole, there were still 0 fries left.\n8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. Since there were no fries left, this statement contradicts the previous information.\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that there is a contradiction in the problem. It is not possible to determine the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it."

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Jessica wants to pay on each debt each month. To pay 50% more than the minimum, she needs to add 50% of the minimum payment to the minimum payment.\n\nFor her student loans, the minimum payment is $300/month. To pay 50% more, she needs to add 50% of $300, which is $150. So she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450/month on her student loans.\n\nFor her credit card, the minimum payment is $200/month. To pay 50% more, she needs to add 50% of $200, which is $100. So she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300/month on her credit card.\n\nFor her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500/month. To pay 50% more, she needs to add 50% of $500, which is $250. So she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750/month on her mortgage.\n\nNow let's calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month by adding up the amounts for each debt: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much Jessica pays in a year by multiplying the monthly amount by 12: $1500/month * 12 months = $18,000/year.\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her student loans, credit card, and mortgage."
"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each task and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy 90 seconds to peel one potato, we can multiply this by the number of potatoes:\n\nTime to peel potatoes = 90 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time it takes to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato, we can multiply this by the number of potatoes:\n\nTime to cut potatoes = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds\n\nNow, we can add the time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes together to find the total time:\n\nTotal time = Time to peel potatoes + Time to cut potatoes\nTotal time = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds\nTotal time = 5700 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take Billy 5700 seconds to finish peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes for the family reunion barbecue."
'To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate their total expenses.\n\nThe cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So their total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.\n\nThey sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So their total revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\nTheir profit per gallon is their revenue per gallon minus their cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nSince they made a profit of $25, they must have sold 5 gallons of lemonade (because $25 / $5 = 5).\n\nTherefore, they spent a total of $5 * 5 = $<<5*5=25>>25 on lemons.'

'To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.\n\nFor the well-rounded team, each member runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by the well-rounded team is 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.\n\nFor the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run their leg in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run their leg in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they run their leg in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken by the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nTo find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time taken by the well-rounded team from the total time taken by the less well-rounded team: 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.'

"Let's start by calculating the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats. We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw and there are 3 cages of rats. So the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 x 3 = 18.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters. We know that each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw and there are 10 cages of hamsters. So the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits. We know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of pieces of straw distributed to each type of rodent: 18 + 50 + 20 = 88.\n\nWe are told that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. So, if we subtract the straw distributed to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits from the total, we can find the remaining straw distributed to other rodents: 160 - 88 = 72.\n\nSince no straw is used anywhere else in the store, the remaining 72 pieces of straw must have been distributed among other rodents. However, we don't have enough information to determine how many rodents there are in total or how many are in each cage. Therefore, we cannot determine how many rats are in each cage based on the given information."
"To calculate the amount that Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the original amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the interest for each month.

"To find the total number of barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons of grapes per acre and then multiply that by the number of barrels of wine per ton.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of tons of grapes produced on the farm. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, we can multiply the number of acres (10) by the number of tons per acre (5) to get:\n\n10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of barrels of wine produced from the grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can multiply the number of tons of grapes (50) by the number of barrels per ton (2) to get:\n\n50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine\n\nTherefore, Josie's 10-acre grape farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
'Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, he used 2 slices of cheese x 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches.\n\nHe also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. This means he used 2 slices of cheese + 1 slice of cheese = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese per omelet.\n\nSo, he used 3 slices of cheese x 3 days = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese for his omelets.\n\nCarl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese for several dinners and used 8 slices of cheese.\n\nTherefore, in total, Carl used 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches + 9 slices of cheese for his omelets + 8 slices of cheese for his macaroni and cheese = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese.'

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 for all six tests, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Brinley has already taken five tests, and we know their scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.\n2. The lowest score is dropped from the calculation, so we need to find the average of the four highest scores.\n3. Brinley wants to achieve an average of 93 for all six tests.\n\nTo find the average of the four highest scores, we need to add them up and divide by 4. Let's calculate:\n\n(89 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 4 = 367 / 4 = 91.75\n\nSo, the average of the four highest scores is 91.75.\n\nTo achieve an average of 93 for all six tests, we need to find the total score Brinley needs to have for all six tests. Let's calculate:\n\n93 * 6 = 558\n\nNow, we need to subtract the sum of the four highest scores from this total to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test:\n\n558 - (89 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 558 - 367 = 191\n\nTherefore, Brinley needs to score 191 on her sixth test in order to achieve an average of 93 for all six tests."

'Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after going to three different stores on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.'
"Let's start by calculating the cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is equal to 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups. Since a dozen is equal to 12 cups, and we have twenty dozen cups, we have a total of 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.\n\nLet's assume the cost of each cup is x dollars. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is 240 * x = 240x dollars.\n\nAccording to the hint, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So we can write the equation:\n\n240x = 36000 - 1200\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n240x = 34800\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 240:\n\nx = 34800 / 240\n\nx = 145\n\nTherefore, the cost of each cup is $145.\n\nThe total cost of purchasing twenty dozen cups is 240 * $145 = $<<240*145=34800>>34800."
"To calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to determine the total cost of the jacket and shoes and then subtract her existing savings and earnings from babysitting.\n\nThe cost of the jacket is $30.\nThe cost of each pair of shoes is $20, so the total cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.\n\nThe total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nSara already has $10 saved, so we subtract that from the total cost: $70 - $10 = $60.\n\nSara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are 4 * $5 = $20.\n\nNow we subtract her earnings from babysitting from the remaining cost: $60 - $20 = $40.\n\nSara's parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.\n\nTherefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times in order to afford the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes."
"Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens.\nSince the white chickens produce 5 eggs each, and Jerry collects 42 eggs in total, the number of white chickens can be calculated as (42 - 3x)/5.\nAccording to the given information, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens. So, we can write the equation as:\n(42 - 3x)/5 = x + 2\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 5, we get:\n42 - 3x = 5x + 10\nAdding 3x to both sides of the equation, we get:\n42 = 8x + 10\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n32 = 8x\nDividing both sides of the equation by 8, we get:\nx = 4\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and divide it by Gary's walking speed.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2 * (6 + 1.5)\nP = 2 * 7.5\nP = 15 miles\n\nSo, the perimeter of the park is 15 miles.\n\nNow, we can divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour\nTime = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park."
"Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\nOn the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.\nOn the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.\nThe total number of customers by the third day was 500.\n\nTo find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.\n\nTotal number of customers by the third day = Number of customers counted on the first day + Number of customers counted on the second day + Number of customers counted on the third day\n\n500 = 100 + 150 + Number of customers counted on the third day\n\nTo find the number of customers counted on the third day, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nNumber of customers counted on the third day = 500 - 100 - 150\nNumber of customers counted on the third day = 250\n\nTherefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's assume that the small pool has x gallons of water currently.\nSince both pools have leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool loses 4*x gallons of water every minute.\nTherefore, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had x + 4*4 = x + 16 gallons of water.\n\nAccording to the hint, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.\nSo, the big pool had 2 * (x + 16) = 2x + 32 gallons of water 4 minutes ago.\n\nNow, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.\nSo, the big pool currently has 4 * x gallons of water.\n\nSince both pools have leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute, the big pool loses 4*x gallons of water every minute.\nTherefore, the big pool had 4*x + 4*4 = 4*x + 16 gallons of water 4 minutes ago.\n\nSince the big pool currently has 4 * x gallons of water, we can set up the equation:\n4*x + 16 = 4 * x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n16 = 0\n\nThis equation is not possible to solve because it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no valid solution for the amount of water in the small pool now."

"Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Griffin had 24 french fries.\n2. Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries. So Griffin is left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.\n4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's assume a handful is 4 fries. So Griffin now has 9 + 4 = 13 fries.\n5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So Griffin is left with 13 - 2 = 11 fries.\n6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 11 = 16 fries.\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 16 fries."
"Let's assume the number of fish in each aquarium is x.\n\nAccording to the hint, there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.\n\nAnd this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, which means 28 = 2x + 2x.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 28 = 4x.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 7.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."

'To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week and then divide the weight of the bag by this amount.\n\nEach person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household. So, the total amount of rice consumed per meal is 0.2 kg/person * 5 people = 1 kg.\n\nSince the household consumes rice for both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 1 kg/meal * 2 meals = 2 kg.\n\nTo find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week. Assuming the household consumes rice every day, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.\n\nNow, we can determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the weight of the bag by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks if 5 members of a household consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal for both lunch and dinner.'

'To find the number of boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to add the number of pencils Jam has and the number of pencils Meg has.\n\nFrom the hint, we know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. So, we can write this as an equation:\n\n3 boxes + 2 loose pencils = 26 pencils\n\nTo find the number of pencils in each box, we can subtract the number of loose pencils from the total number of pencils:\n\n26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in the boxes\n\nNow, we need to add the number of pencils Meg has, which is 46 pencils:\n\n24 pencils in the boxes + 46 pencils = 70 pencils\n\nSo, Jam and Meg need a total of 70 pencils to store all their pencils.\n\nSince each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box to find the number of boxes needed:\n\n70 pencils ÷ 24 pencils/box = 2.9167 boxes\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 3 boxes to store all their pencils.'
"To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs to use 65/13 = 5 ice cubes.\nEach ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.\nIn addition, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee.\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee becomes 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker when she cools it by 65 degrees and adds 15 milliliters of cream.

"Let's assume that each person brought in x old records. Since each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the 5 people brought in a total of 5x old records.\n\nSince the 5 people left with a total of 7 new records, it means that they traded in a total of 7 new records. Since each new record is obtained by trading in 2 old records, the 7 new records represent 2 * 7 = 14 old records.\n\nTherefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 5x = 14 old records.\n\nTo find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 14 / 5 = 2.8.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a record, we can conclude that the 5 people brought in a total of 2 old records each. Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 5 * 2 = 10 old records."

"Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Some people got on the bus at the terminal.\nThis means that there is an initial number of people who boarded the bus at the terminal, but we don't know the exact number yet.\n\n2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.\nThis means that after the first bus stop, there are 5 more people on the bus than the initial number.\n\n3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.\nThis means that after the second bus stop, there are 7 fewer people on the bus than after the first stop, but then 8 more people got in. So the total change in the number of people from the first stop to the second stop is -7 + 8 = 1.\n\n4. There were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.\nThis means that after the third stop, there are 20 people on the bus.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal:\n\nLet's assume the initial number of people who boarded the bus at the terminal is x.\n\nAfter the first stop, there are x + 5 people on the bus.\nAfter the second stop, there are (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 people on the bus.\nAfter the third stop, there are x + 6 - 20 = x - 14 people on the bus.\n\nSince we know that after the third stop there are 20 people on the bus, we can set up the equation:\n\nx - 14 = 20\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n\nx = 20 + 14\nx = 34\n\nTherefore, the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal is 34."

"The customer's loyalty card gives them $1 off for every $20 spent. Therefore, for the last shopping trip where they spent $80, they earned $80 / $20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.\n\nOn this shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their rewards, which means they received a discount of $4. The coupon they applied took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so it took $4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8 off the price.\n\nTherefore, the total discount applied to the price is $4 + $8 = $<<4+8=12>>12.\n\nTo find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to subtract the discount from the total price. The total price before any discounts or rewards were applied is $43.\n\nSo, the customer paid $43 - $12 = $<<43-12=31>>31 on this shopping trip."

Let's assume he buys x pounds of candy.\n\nThe cost of x pounds of candy is 1.5x dollars.\n\nAfter buying the candy, Billy has 10 - 1.5x dollars left.\n\nBilly spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He buys 40 gumballs, so he spends 0.05 * 40 = $2 on gumballs.\n\nBilly has 10 - 1.5x - 2 = 8 - 1.5x dollars left.\n\nSince he spends half of his change on gumballs, he has 8 - 1.5x dollars left, which is equal to half of his change.\n\nTherefore, 8 - 1.5x = (1/2) * (10 - 1.5x).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 8 - 1.5x = 5 - 0.75x.\n\nAdding 0.75x to both sides, we get 8 - 0.75x = 5.\n\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get -0.75x = -3.\n\nDividing both sides by -0.75, we get x = 4.\n\nTherefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's assume the age of Carver's son is x years.\nAccording to the hint, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so Carver's age can be represented as 2x - 5.\nGiven that Carver is 45 years old, we can set up the equation:\n2x - 5 = 45\nAdding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n2x = 50\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\nx = 25\nTherefore, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"The train travels a total distance of 675 miles per day. Since it does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 675 * 3 = 2025 miles.\n\nThe train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. So the total distance for each trip is 75 + 100 + (100-50) = 325 miles.\n\nTherefore, the train travels a total distance of 2025 miles in a day, and it needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the distance between services: 18,000 / 2025 = 8.8888...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 9 days."
"To find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to determine the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed.\n\nA bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.\nA bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.\n\nThe average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing Mark needs.\n\nFor 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.\nFor 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs a total of 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To find the total time for the round trip, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nTime to friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.857 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.\n\nTime back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for the detour. The distance of the detour is 10 miles and the speed is not given, but we can assume it is the same as the speed to the friend's house, which is 70 mph.\n\nTime for detour = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.143 hours.\n\nFinally, to find the total time for the round trip, we add up the times for each leg of the trip.\n\nTotal time = Time to friend's house + Time for detour + Time back home\n= 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours + 3 hours\n= 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the trip took John a total of 6 hours."

'To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to determine how many points she has already scored on the first two tests and subtract that from the total number of points needed.\n\nJane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. Therefore, she has scored a total of 15 + 18 = 33 points on the first two tests.\n\nTo pass, Jane needs a total of at least 42 points on all three tests. Therefore, she needs to score a minimum of 42 - 33 = 9 points on her third test to pass.'
"Let's solve this step by step.\n\nLet's assume the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is x.\nAccording to the hint, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.\nAnd the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(4x - 5).\n\nSo, the total number of customers kicked out is x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nx + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50\n17x - 20 = 50\n17x = 70\nx = 70/17\nx ≈ 4.12\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a customer, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 4.\n\nSo, 4 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.\nThe number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4(4) - 5 = 11.\nAnd the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(11) = 33.\n\nNow, let's find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.\nTotal customers kicked out = 50\nCustomers kicked out for refusing to wear masks = 4\nCustomers kicked out for shoplifting = 11\nCustomers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale = 33\n\nSo, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 4 - 11 - 33 = 2.\n\nTherefore, 2 customers were kicked out of Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence over goods on sale."
"Let's assume that Erin had x points before scoring 14 points.\n\nAccording to the information given, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. This means Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points.\n\nWe also know that Erin scored 14 points, so her total points now are x + 14.\n\nSince Erin now has 24 points, we can set up the equation x + 14 = 24.\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 14 = 10.\n\nTherefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points."
'There are 44 seniors who need to receive awards. Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. So the cost of the picture frames alone would be 44 * $20 = $<<44*20=880>>880.\n\nEach picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame. The additional cost for etching would be 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $<<0.20*20=4>>4 per frame.\n\nSo the total cost of etching for all the frames would be 44 * $4 = $<<44*4=176>>176.\n\nTwo of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each. So the cost of the pins would be 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\n\nOne-fourth of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each. So the number of officers would be 44 / 4 = <<44/4=11>>11.\n\nThe cost of cords for the officers would be 11 * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the senior gifts, including picture frames, etching, pins, and cords, would be $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $<<880+176+10+132=1198>>1198.

"To find the profit per hour that Millie makes from running her lemonade stand, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue. Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, her total revenue per hour is 1 * 4 = $4.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so Millie can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.\n\nSince Millie sells all of the lemonade she makes, the total cost per cup of lemonade is 18 / 36 = $0.5.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the profit per hour. The profit per hour is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 4 - 0.5 = $3.5.\n\nTherefore, Millie makes a profit of $3.5 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand."
"Let's assume the original size of Mr. Ruther's land was x hectares.\n\nAccording to the information given, Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he sold (3/5)x hectares.\n\nAfter selling, he had 12.8 hectares left, so the equation becomes:\n\nx - (3/5)x = 12.8\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for 1 and 5, which is 5. So, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n5x - 3x = 12.8 * 5\n2x = 64\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\nx = 32\n\nTherefore, the original size of Mr. Ruther's land was 32 hectares."

"Let's break down the information given in the hint and question:\n\n1. Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.\n2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.\n3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\n4. After finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.\n\nTo find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took on his walks to and from school and the steps he took with his friend from the total steps he needs to take.\n\nTotal steps Elliott needs to take = 10,000 steps\n\nSteps Elliott took on his walks to and from school = 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps\n\nSteps Elliott took with his friend = 1,000 steps\n\nRemaining steps after walks and walk with friend = 10,000 steps - 5,000 steps - 1,000 steps = 4,000 steps\n\nSince Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can subtract this from the remaining steps to find out how many steps he took during his jog.\n\nSteps Elliott took during his jog = Remaining steps - Steps left after jog = 4,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 2,000 steps\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
'First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and each page averages 200 words, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the entire book.\n\nNow we need to calculate the total time Toby needs to get to the airport. It takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport and he needs to be there in 60 minutes, so the total time needed is 10 + 60 = 70 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport. Since Toby finishes reading the book in 30 minutes and needs to be at the airport in 70 minutes, he will be early by 70 - 30 = 40 minutes.'
"In May, the company hired 40 employees, each earning $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. \n\nThe total amount paid to each employee in May is $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $<<15*40=600>>600/week.\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600/week * 4 weeks = $<<600*4=2400>>2400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400/employee * 40 employees = $<<2400*40=96000>>96000.\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees' contracts expired.\n\nTherefore, the company paid 40 employees - 10 expired contracts = <<40-10=30>>30 employees in June.\n\nThe total amount paid to each employee in June is $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $<<15*40=600>>600/week.\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600/week * 4 weeks = $<<600*4=2400>>2400.\n\nTherefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400/employee * 30 employees = $<<2400*30=72000>>72000.\n\nThe total amount paid to all employees in May and June is $96000 + $72000 = $<<96000+72000=168000>>168000.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6, so the total cost of the jeans without the discount is $28 + $22 = $<<28+22=50>>50.\n\nNow, let's find 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. 1/3 of $6 is $6/3 = $<<6/3=2>>2.\n\nSince Cole saved $6 in total and $2 of that came from the jogger jeans, the rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4, came from the tattered jeans.\n\nTo find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to subtract the savings from the cost of the jogger jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.\n\nFinally, we subtract the savings from the cost of the tattered jeans to find the original cost of the tattered jeans. The original cost of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.\n\nTherefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $32 = $<<24-32=-8>>-8 more than the tattered jeans.\n\nHowever, it doesn't make sense for the jogger jeans to cost a negative amount more than the tattered jeans. This means there may be an error in the given information or calculations. Please double-check the information and calculations to find the correct answer."

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase from baking. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours and every hour the oven is on it raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the total temperature increase from baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees.\n\nSo after baking, the temperature of the house is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = <<40+15=55>>55 degrees.\n\nNext, let's calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window. Since Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, the total temperature decrease from opening the window is (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees/10 minutes = 6 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees."
"Let's first calculate how much time James saved in the swim compared to Jon. Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, and James finished 10% faster, so he saved 40 * 0.1 = <<40*0.1=4>>4 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it took James to complete the bike ride. Jon took 80 minutes, and James took 5 minutes longer, so James took 80 + 5 = <<80+5=85>>85 minutes for the bike ride.\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. Jon's swim time was 40 minutes, his bike ride time was 80 minutes, and his run time was 50 minutes, so his total time was 40 + 80 + 50 = <<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes.\n\nSince Jon won the race by 10 minutes, James must have finished the triathlon in 170 - 10 = <<170-10=160>>160 minutes.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how long it took James to complete the run. We know that James' swim time was 4 minutes faster than Jon's, his bike ride time was 85 minutes, and his total time was 160 minutes. Therefore, his run time was 160 - 4 - 85 = <<160-4-85=71>>71 minutes.\n\nSo, it took James 71 minutes to complete the run in the triathlon."
'To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow the given information and hints step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 1.25 by 60:\n\n1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes\n\nSo, Movie C was 75 minutes long.\n\nNext, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we can find the length of Movie B by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:\n\n75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes\n\nSo, Movie B was 80 minutes long.\n\nFinally, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4:\n\n80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes\n\nTherefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long.'
"First, we need to calculate how many miles Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32MPH. We can use the formula distance = speed * time.\n\nDistance = 32 miles/hour * (30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 16 miles\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many bails of hay Michael's horse eats. We know that for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, the horse eats 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.\n\nMichael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.\n\nTo find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has: $30 - $24 = $6.\n\nTherefore, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay for his horse."

So, the total number of cookies he can have is x/2 + 2.\n\nWe know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/2 + 2 = 5\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx/2 = 5 - 2\nx/2 = 3\n\nTo isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 3 * 2\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have 5 cookies as a snack."
'To find the percentage of the combined length of the remoras compared to the length of the shark, we need to convert the lengths to the same unit of measurement.\n\nThe shark is 10 feet long, and each remora is 6 inches long. We need to convert the length of the remoras to feet to match the unit of measurement of the shark.\n\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, each remora is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.\n\nThe combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.\n\nTo find the percentage, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage = (1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%\n\nTherefore, the combined length of the 6-inch remoras is 10% of the length of the 10-foot shark.'
"Let's assume the total number of students at that grade level is x.\nAccording to the hint, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. So, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x.\nWe are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. So, the number of students without desktop computers is 20.\nTherefore, the number of students with desktop computers is x - 20.\nAccording to the hint, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x.\nSo, we can write the equation:\n(3/4)x = x - 20\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n3x = 4(x - 20)\n3x = 4x - 80\nSubtracting 4x from both sides of the equation, we get:\n-x = -80\nDividing both sides of the equation by -1, we get:\nx = 80\nTherefore, there are 80 students at that grade level."

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angles involved and how they change over time.\n\nFirst, let's consider the angle between the ground and the Great Pyramids, which is given as 32 degrees. This angle remains constant throughout the problem.\n\nNext, let's consider the angle at which the sun is moving relative to the pyramid. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid. This means that after 1 hour, the angle between the ground and the sun will be 32 + 5 = 37 degrees. After 2 hours, it will be 32 + 2 * 5 = 42 degrees, and so on.\n\nSince the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we can calculate the angle between the ground and the sun after it moves for 10 hours by adding 10 * 5 = 50 degrees to the initial angle of 32 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the ground and the sun after it moves for 10 hours relative to the Great Pyramids is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees."

'To find out how many years it will take for a tire to need replacement, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a month and then divide it by the total number of rotations the tire can handle.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many rotations the tire undergoes in a month. We know that Jeremy drives 400 miles per month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So, the total number of rotations in a month is:\n\n400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 290,000 rotations\n\nNext, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle (10,440,000 rotations) by the total number of rotations in a month (290,000 rotations) to find out how many months the tire will last:\n\n10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations = 36 months\n\nFinally, we divide the number of months by 12 to find out how many years it will take for the tire to need replacement:\n\n36 months / 12 = 3 years\n\nTherefore, it will take 3 years for the tire to need replacement.'
'The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo for 120 washings. This means that each wash requires 2 pumps of shampoo.\n\nIf Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, then she will need half the amount of shampoo for each wash compared to the directions. Therefore, the jumbo bottle of shampoo will last her twice as long.\n\nSince the jumbo bottle of shampoo is meant to last for 120 washings, and Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, the jumbo bottle of shampoo will last her for 240 washings.\n\nTo find the cost of each pump of shampoo, we need to divide the total cost of the jumbo bottle ($24.00) by the total number of pumps it contains (240 pumps).\n\n$24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump\n\nTherefore, each pump of shampoo costs 10 cents.'

"Manny signed up for 10 Karate classes for $60. This means that each class costs $60/10 = $6.\n\nHis parents have set a limit of $10 per class for the cost of the classes. Since each class costs $6, Manny is well within this limit.\n\nThe question is asking how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up for Karate again.\n\nIf Manny misses a class, he will still have attended 10-1 = 9 classes.\nThe cost of attending 9 classes is 9*$6 = $<<9*6=54>>54.\n\nSince Manny's parents have set a limit of $10 per class, Manny can miss a maximum of $60-$10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.\n\nTo find out how many classes Manny can miss, we divide the maximum amount he can spend by the cost per class: $50/$6 = <<50/6=8.33>>8.33.\n\nSince Manny cannot attend a fraction of a class, he can miss a maximum of 8 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up for Karate again.\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss 8 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up for Karate again."

"Let's assume that Lynn ran x miles.\n\nAccording to the information given, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nReggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran x + 3 miles.\n\nSince Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together, the total distance they ran is 4 + 20 + (x + 3) = 27 + x miles.\n\nBut we know that the total distance they ran is also the sum of the distances each person ran, so 27 + x = 4 + x + 20 + (x + 3).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 27 + x = 27 + 2x + 3.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 27 + x = 30 + 2x.\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get 27 = 30 + x.\n\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get -3 = x.\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran -3 miles.\n\nHowever, it is not possible for Lynn to have run a negative distance, so there must be an error in the given information or calculations. Please double-check the information and calculations to find the correct answer."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each apple and each orange separately.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one apple. We know that four apples cost $5.20, so we can divide the total cost by the number of apples: $5.20 / 4 = $1.30 per apple.\n\nNext, let's find the cost of one orange. We know that three oranges cost $3.30, so we can divide the total cost by the number of oranges: $3.30 / 3 = $1.10 per orange.\n\nNow that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.\n\nThe cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.\nThe cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nTherefore, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges in the grocery store."

'To find the total distance biked by Alisa, we can multiply her speed (12 miles per hour) by the time she biked (4.5 hours):\n\nDistance biked by Alisa = Speed * Time = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles\n\nSimilarly, to find the total distance biked by Stanley, we can multiply his speed (10 miles per hour) by the time he biked (2.5 hours):\n\nDistance biked by Stanley = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles\n\nTherefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is the sum of their individual distances:\n\nTotal distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles\n\nSo, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.'
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig through 24 feet of soil. So the time it takes to dig through the soil is 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so he can dig 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour through clay. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time it takes to dig through the clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.\n\nNow, let's add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well. 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well in his backyard."

This means there are now 12 x 2 = 24 dogs in the shelter.\n\nHowever, 3 dogs have left the shelter. Since James no longer needs toys for these 3 dogs, he subtracts them from the total number of dogs. So, he now needs toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.\n\nTherefore, James needs a total of 21 toys for the dogs in his shelter.'
"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.\nThis means that the total amount of money invested is $1200.\n\n2. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.\nTo find out how much Dylan invested, we need to calculate 2/5 of $1200.\nDylan's investment = (2/5) * $1200 = $480\n\n3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.\nAfter Dylan's investment, there is a remaining amount of $1200 - $480 = $720.\nTo find out how much Frances invested, we need to calculate 2/3 of $720.\nFrances' investment = (2/3) * $720 = $480\n\n4. Skyler's investment accounted for the rest.\nSince Dylan and Frances have already invested a total of $480 + $480 = $960, the remaining amount for Skyler's investment is $1200 - $960 = $240.\n\nTherefore, Skyler's investment in the joint savings account was $240."

"First, we need to determine how many movies are part of various series. Since a third of the movies are part of series, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of movies by 1/3: 600 movies * 1/3 = <<600*1/3=200>>200 movies.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies and then multiplying by 40%: (600 movies - 200 movies) * 40% = 160 movies.\n\nNow, we can determine how many movies are the rest of the movies. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of movies in series and older movies from the total number of movies: 600 movies - 200 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies.\n\nNext, we can calculate the cost of the movies in series by multiplying the number of movies in series by the cost per movie: 200 movies * $6/movie = $<<200*6=1200>>1200.\n\nThen, we can calculate the cost of the older movies by multiplying the number of older movies by the cost per movie: 160 movies * $5/movie = $<<160*5=800>>800.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the cost of the rest of the movies by multiplying the number of rest of the movies by the cost per movie: 240 movies * $10/movie = $<<240*10=2400>>2400.\n\nTo find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we add the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the rest of the movies: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $<<1200+800+2400=4400>>4400.

So the cost of the apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00.\n\nTo find out how much Winston spent on fruit in total, we add up the costs of each type of fruit: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.\n\nTherefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.'
'The Llesis family drove for 4.5 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they drove is 4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = <<4.5*50=225>>225 miles.\n\nTo find the speed at which they hiked, we need to find half their driving speed and subtract 5 miles per hour. Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour. Subtracting 5 miles per hour gives us a hiking speed of 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.\n\nSince they hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, the distance they hiked is 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = <<1.5*20=30>>30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 miles + 30 miles = <<225+30=255>>255 miles.'
"Let's break down the points earned by Ava and Emma separately.\n\nAva's points:\n- Enemies jumped on: Ava gets 10 points for each enemy jumped on. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, she earns 10 * 8 = 80 points more than Emma in this category.\n- Berries collected: Ava gets 5 points for each berry collected. Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 points more than Emma in this category.\n- Time left on the timer: Ava gets 30 points for every second left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, she earns 30 * 4 = 120 points less than Emma in this category.\n\nNow let's calculate the total points earned by Ava and Emma:\n\nAva's total points = Points from enemies jumped on + Points from berries collected + Points from time left on the timer\n= 80 + 15 - 120\n= -25\n\nEmma's points:\n- Enemies jumped on: Emma earns 10 points for each enemy jumped on.\n- Berries collected: Emma earns 5 points for each berry collected.\n- Time left on the timer: Emma earns 30 points for every second left on the timer.\n\nSince we don't have specific numbers for Emma's performance, we cannot calculate her total points.

'According to the given information, there were 10 quarts of tea left from the party. This means that the total amount of tea consumed by the students is the initial amount of tea minus the amount left:\n\nTotal amount of tea consumed = Initial amount of tea - Amount left\nTotal amount of tea consumed = Initial amount of tea - 10 quarts\n\nWe also know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea and 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students can be calculated as:\n\nTotal amount of tea consumed by 4 students = 4 students x 1.5 quarts = 6 quarts\nTotal amount of tea consumed by 16 students = 16 students x 2 quarts = 32 quarts\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tea consumed by the students is:\n\nTotal amount of tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation for the total amount of tea consumed:\n\n38 quarts = Initial amount of tea - 10 quarts\n\nTo find the initial amount of tea, we need to isolate the variable:\n\nInitial amount of tea = 38 quarts + 10 quarts\nInitial amount of tea = 48 quarts\n\nFinally, to convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon):\n\nInitial amount of tea in gallons = 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons\n\nTherefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.'

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, so he can play for 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12 games.\n\nHis two friends who are worse than him can only play half as long, so they can each play for 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, each of them can play for 240 / 10 = <<240/10=24>>24 games.\n\nHis friend who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, he can play for 240 / 30 = <<240/30=8>>8 games.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of games played by all four friends. Jack played 12 games, his two worse friends played 24 games each, and his better friend played 8 games. So the total number of games played is 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = <<12+24+24+8=68>>68 games.\n\nSince each game costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money spent is 68 * $0.25 = $<<68*0.25=17>>17.

'Let\'s assume that the speed of one kangaroo is represented by "x" units per hour. Since all three kangaroos are traveling at the same speed, the combined speed of the three kangaroos is 3x units per hour.\n\nWe are given that it takes the three kangaroos a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can write the equation:\n\ndistance = (3x) × 18\n\nNow, let\'s consider the speed of one turtle, which is half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is (1/2)x units per hour.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the four turtles to travel across the highway, we need to determine the distance they need to cover. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up the equation:\n\ndistance = (1/2)x × time\n\nWe know that the distance is the same for both equations, so we can equate them:\n\n(3x) × 18 = (1/2)x × time\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n54x = (1/2)x × time\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by x, we get:\n\n54 = (1/2) × time\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\n108 = time\n\nTherefore, it will take the four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 108 hours to travel across the highway.'

'Let\'s break down the information given in the hint and question:\n\n1. The pirates dug ten holes on the first day.\n2. They dug thirteen holes on the second day.\n3. They dug eight holes on the third day.\n4. They filled in two holes on the third day.\n5. The island had four times as many holes on the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.\n6. The pirates found the treasure chest on the fourth day.\n\nTo find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that the pirates dug ten holes on the first day. Let\'s represent the number of holes at the end of the first day as "x."\n\nAccording to point 5, the island had four times as many holes on the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes on the fourth day is 4x.\n\nOn the second day, the pirates dug thirteen holes, which means the total number of holes at the end of the second day is x + 13.\n\nOn the third day, the pirates dug eight holes and filled in two holes. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is (x + 13 + 8) - 2, which simplifies to x + 19.\n\nFinally, on the fourth day, the pirates found the treasure chest. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 4x - (x + 19).\n\nSimplifying further, we get 4x - x - 19, which equals 3x - 19.\n\nSo, the pirates dug 3x - 19 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.'

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each leg of the journey and then add them together.\n\nIn the first leg of the journey, the bird flies in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this leg can be calculated using the formula distance = speed × time. So, the distance traveled in the first leg is 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.\n\nIn the second leg of the journey, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. Again, using the formula distance = speed × time, the distance traveled in this leg is 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.\n\nIn the final leg of the journey, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = speed × time, the distance traveled in this leg is 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\nTo find the total distance traveled, we add up the distances traveled in each leg: 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."

On Saturday, he caught half of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish. \n\nTo find out how many servings Joe has, we need to add up the pounds of crawfish he caught on each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. \n\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total pounds by the weight of one serving to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7 servings. \n\nTherefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, we need to find the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. We know that 20% of the class are football players, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 20%:\n\n30 students * 20% = 6 students\n\nSo there are 6 football players in Mr. Roper's class.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. We can do this by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:\n\n30 students - 6 students = 24 students\n\nSo there are 24 students who are not football players.\n\nNow we need to find the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band. We know that 25% of the non-football player students fall into this category, so we can calculate this by multiplying the number of non-football player students by 25%:\n\n24 students * 25% = 6 students\n\nSo there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of students who will be leaving early for the away game. This includes the football players, cheerleaders, and band members. We can calculate this by adding the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:\n\n6 football players + 6 students = 12 students\n\nSo there are 12 students in Mr. Roper's class who will be leaving early today to travel to an away game."

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider her rate of peeling and sautéing shrimp.\n\nFrom the hint, we know that Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide 90 by 6:\n\n90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes\n\nSo, it will take Emily 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide 90 by 30:\n\n90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 sets of 10 minutes\n\nSo, it will take Emily 3 sets of 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes, to sauté 90 shrimp.\n\nFinally, to find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to sauté:\n\n15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."

'To determine how old Bill was when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to calculate the age difference between the two sightings.\n\nWe know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill\'s dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Let\'s denote the age difference between the two sightings as "x" years.\n\nSo, when Bill saw the Comet for the second time, he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. This can be expressed as:\n\n30 + x = 3(30 + x)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n30 + x = 90 + 3x\n\n2x = 60\n\nx = 30\n\nTherefore, the age difference between the two sightings is 30 years.\n\nNow, to determine how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to subtract the age difference from the age he was when he saw it for the second time.\n\nIf Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it, then Bill\'s age at the second sighting was:\n\n3(30 + x) = 3(30 + 30) = 3(60) = 180 years old\n\nSo, Bill was 180 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\nTo find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we subtract the age difference:\n\n180 - 30 = 150\n\nTherefore, Bill was 150 years old when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.'

"Let's assume that the first plane makes x trips in one day. \n\nAccording to the hint, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * x = 3x/4.\n\nThe remaining flights of the first plane are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is (x - 3x/4)/2 = (4x - 3x)/8 = x/8.\n\nThe second plane makes 44 trips in one day, which is half the number of trips made by the first plane. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips in one day.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:\nx + 88 = 2x\n88 = x\n\nTherefore, the first plane makes 88 trips in one day.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of flights to France:\nx/8 = 88/8 = 11\n\nSo, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."

"To solve this problem, we need to divide the watermelon into 6 equal parts, with each adult receiving a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.\n\nLet's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Then, the size of each adult's slice would be 2x.\n\nSince there are 4 kids, the total size of the kids' slices would be 4x. And since there are 2 adults, the total size of the adults' slices would be 2 * 2x = 4x.\n\nTherefore, the total size of the watermelon is 4x + 4x = 8x.\n\nTo find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the size of each adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100.\n\nEach adult's slice is 4x, so the percentage each adult gets is (4x / 8x) * 100 = 50%.\n\nTherefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on rounds. Since each round takes twenty minutes per inpatient and he has nine inpatients, the total time spent on rounds is 20 minutes/inpatient * 9 inpatients = <<20*9=180>>180 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. Since each appointment takes thirty minutes and he has ten appointments, the total time spent on appointments is 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = <<30*10=300>>300 minutes.\n\nNow, let's convert the time spent on rounds and appointments to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the time spent on rounds is 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<180/60=3>>3 hours. The time spent on appointments is 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<300/60=5>>5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time spent on rounds and appointments is 3 hours + 5 hours = <<3+5=8>>8 hours.\n\nSince Doctor Jones is spending nine hours at the clinic on Monday, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records."
'To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.\n\nFirst, we need to account for the time it takes to frost the cake, which is an additional 10 minutes.

"To calculate the expected monthly earnings of the dance studio, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the number of students attending lessons.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of renting the studio for a week. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly cost of renting the studio is 3 * $25 = $<<3*25=75>>75.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the students attending lessons for a week. The studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost of the students attending lessons is 10 * $1.50 * 3 = $<<10*1.5*3=45>>45.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weekly cost, which is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students attending lessons. The total weekly cost is $75 + $45 = $<<75+45=120>>120.\n\nTo calculate the expected monthly earnings, we need to multiply the total weekly cost by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the expected monthly earnings of the dance studio is $120 * 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480.\n\nTherefore, the expected monthly earnings of the dance studio, considering the cost of renting the studio and the number of students attending lessons, is $480."

"On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\nSo, on the first day, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons into the tank.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\nMs. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\nSo, on the second day, they pumped a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons into the tank.\n\nTherefore, in two days, they pumped a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons into the tank.\n\nTo find the remaining gallons for the tank to be full, we subtract the total pumped gallons from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's assume the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went to the park was x%.\n\nAccording to the information given, Maria noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour while charging her friends' phones. This means that for every hour, the power bank was losing 9% of its remaining charge.\n\nAfter 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. This means that for these 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of its remaining charge.\n\nWe can calculate the charge remaining in the power bank after these 5 hours and 3 hours of charging her friends' phones.\n\nAfter 5 hours, the power bank would have lost 5 * 9% = 45% of its initial charge.\nSo, the charge remaining after 5 hours of charging her friends' phones would be x% - 45%.\n\nAfter the next 3 hours, the power bank would have lost 3 * 7% = 21% of its remaining charge.\nSo, the charge remaining after 5 hours and 3 hours of charging her friends' phones would be (x% - 45%) - 21%.\n\nAccording to the given information, the charge remaining in the power bank at the end was 28%. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(x% - 45%) - 21% = 28%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx% - 45% - 21% = 28%\nx% - 66% = 28%\nx% = 28% + 66%\nx% = 94%\n\nTherefore, the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went to the park was 94%."

'To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the price increase for each year. The price increases by 5% of the original price every year. So, the price increase for the first year would be 5% of $120, which is (5/100) * $120 = $6.\n\nTo find the price after the first year, we add the price increase to the initial price: $120 + $6 = $126.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the price increase for the second year. The price increase is again 5% of the original price, which is (5/100) * $126 = $6.30.\n\nTo find the price after the second year, we add the price increase to the price after the first year: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the price increase for the third year. The price increase is 5% of the original price, which is (5/100) * $132.30 = $6.615.\n\nTo find the price after the third year, we add the price increase to the price after the second year: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.'

"First, let's calculate how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. One dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, which means he can mine an additional 50/100 * 24 = 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.\nSo, one dwarf can mine a total of 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine a total of 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, in 30 days they can mine a total of 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.\n\nTherefore, 40 dwarves, each equipped with a steel pickaxe, can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days."

"Let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.\n2. 40% of the red balloons burst due to a gust of wind.\n   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst\n   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons\n3. Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.\n   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons released\n   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons\n4. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree near the school.\n5. Sally added 75% of the blue balloons she found to her remaining clutch of balloons.\n   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added\n   - Total blue balloons = 8 + 6 = 14 blue balloons\n6. Sally carried the final number of balloons into the school.\n   - Total balloons = Remaining red balloons + Remaining green balloons + Remaining yellow balloons + Total blue balloons\n   - Total balloons = 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 14 blue balloons\n   - Total balloons = 42 balloons\n\nTherefore, Sally carried 42 balloons into the school."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario.\n\n1. If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. This has a 50% chance of happening.\n\n2. If the normal teacher comes in, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension. This means there is a 60% chance she won't give an extension.\n\n3. If the class doesn't get an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there is an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.\n\nTo calculate the overall probability, we multiply the probabilities of each scenario:\n\n(50% chance of substitute teacher) * (60% chance of no extension) * (80% chance of no personal extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24\n\nSo, there is a 24% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow."

'To calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn enough money to repay his college loans and make up for the income he lost while in school, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Income before college: Jim had a $25,000 per year job before college.\n2. Income after college: His college degree tripled his income, so he will be earning $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year after college.\n3. Loans per year: Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total loans amount to $50,000 x 4 = $200,000.\n4. Income lost while in school: Jim was not working while in school for 4 years, so he lost $25,000 x 4 = $100,000 in income.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn enough money to repay his college loans and make up for the income he lost while in school, we need to add the loans amount and the income lost amount: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.\n\nNow, we can calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income level of $75,000 per year: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim another 4 years at his new income level to earn enough money to repay his college loans and make up for the income he lost while in school.'

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.\n\nTo find the average amount of money Johnny's dad lost on horse racing that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and divide it by the number of races.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad won in the second race. We know that he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which means he won $5 * 2 + $1 = $11.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the third race. We know that he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which means he lost $11 * 1.5 = $16.50.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Johnny's dad lost. He lost $5 in the first race, $16.50 in the third race, and nothing in the second race because he won. So the total amount lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.\n\nSince there were three races, we divide the total amount lost by 3 to find the average amount lost per race.

"Let's assume that Maggie had x dollars and Riza had y dollars initially.\n\nAccording to the hint, Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent (1/4)x dollars. So, she has (x - (1/4)x) = (3/4)x dollars left.\n\nSimilarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent (1/3)y dollars. So, she has (y - (1/3)y) = (2/3)y dollars left.\n\nAccording to the question, both Maggie and Riza had $60 left after spending a portion of their money. So, we have the following equations:\n\n(3/4)x = 60   ...(1)\n(2/3)y = 60   ...(2)\n\nTo find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\nx = (4/3) * 60\nx = 80\n\nFrom equation (2), we have:\ny = (3/2) * 60\ny = 90\n\nTherefore, Maggie has $80 left and Riza has $90 left."
"Let's start by finding out how many bananas the second monkey eats each day. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas each day.\n\nNow, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat together each day. The total number of bananas they eat is 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.\n\nSince the bananas are enough to feed the three monkeys for a week, we need to find out how many bananas they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas they eat in a week is 24 x 7 = <<24*7=168>>168 bananas.\n\nNow, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. Therefore, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = <<315-24=291>>291 bananas each day.\n\nSo, the third monkey eats 291/7 = <<291/7=41.57>>41.57 bananas each day.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a banana, the third monkey eats 41 bananas each day.\n\nTherefore, the third monkey eats 41 bananas each day."

"To find out how long Paul will have to wait for the fourth train, we need to calculate the arrival times and durations of the first three trains.\n\n1. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means that the first train will leave the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after it arrives.\n\n2. The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves the station 30 minutes after it arrives, the second train will arrive 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.\n\n3. The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves the station 60 minutes after the first train arrives, the third train will arrive 60 + 60 = 120 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train will leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it won't stay in the station.\n\n4. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train doesn't stay in the station, the fourth train will arrive 120 + 20 = 140 minutes after the first train arrives.\n\nTherefore, Paul will have to wait for 140 minutes for the fourth train to arrive."

"To find the time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk half the distance to the store and then double that time.\n\nThe distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, it would take him 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour to walk the entire distance to the store.\n\nHowever, James realized he forgot something at home when he reached halfway to the store. Halfway to the store is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.\n\nTo find the time it took James to walk half the distance, we divide the distance by his walking speed: 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.\n\nSince James had to walk back to his home, he had to cover the same distance again. So, the total time it took him to reach the store is 0.5 hours * 2 = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."

'To calculate how much Lauren needs to save for retirement, we first need to determine her annual savings. \n\nLauren is currently saving 20% of her paycheck, so her annual savings can be calculated as follows:\n\nAnnual savings = 20% * $100,000 = $20,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much Lauren plans to live on during retirement. She wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which can be calculated as follows:\n\nRetirement income = 40% * $100,000 = $40,000\n\nNow, we can calculate how much Lauren needs to save for a 20-year retirement period. \n\nTotal savings needed = Retirement income * Retirement period = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000\n\nSince Lauren is currently saving $20,000 per year, we can calculate how many more years she needs to work to save enough for retirement:\n\nYears needed to save = Total savings needed / Annual savings = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years in order to save enough for a 20-year retirement period, while living on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000.'
'To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of cuts.\n\nFirst, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. Each part will be 100/4 = 25 centimeters long.\n\nNext, we divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts. Each part will now be 25/5 = 5 centimeters long.\n\nTherefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.'
"Let's assume the total number of students in the school is x.\n\nAccording to the hint, 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. This means that 40% of x is equal to 240 boys.\n\nTo find 40% of x, we can multiply x by 40% (or 0.4):\n\n0.4x = 240\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:\n\nx = 240 / 0.4\n\nx = 600\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the school is 600.\n\nTo find the number of girls in the school, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys\nNumber of girls = 600 - 240\nNumber of girls = 360\n\nSo, there are 360 girls in the school."

'To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and divide it by the number of women.\n\nThere are three women wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height contributed by them is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.\n\nSimilarly, there are three women wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height contributed by them is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.\n\nThe total height of all the heels at the party is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.\n\nSince there are a total of 6 women at the party, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.\n\nTherefore, the average height of heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is 3 inches.'
'Soledad wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles within the month of June. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. \n\nTo find out how many miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to calculate the total number of miles she will cover in a day.\n\nSince she plans to walk twice a day, she will cover a total of 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles in a day.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many days it will take for Soledad to complete her journey. \n\nTo do this, we divide the total distance she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the distance she covers in a day (250 miles).\n\n9,300 miles / 250 miles = 37.2 days\n\nSince Soledad wants to complete her journey within the month of June, which has 30 days, she will need to hike for 37.2 days. \n\nHowever, since she cannot hike for a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Soledad will need to hike for 38 days.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time.\n\nTo do this, we subtract the total distance she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the distance she will cover in 38 days (250 miles/day * 38 days).\n\n9,300 miles - (250 miles/day * 38 days) = 9,300 miles - 9,500 miles = -200 miles\n\nThe result is -200 miles, which means that Soledad has already exceeded her target distance by 200 miles. Therefore, she does not need to hike any more miles per day to complete her journey on time.'
'To find out how much money the store will make by selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total cost of the red balls, blue balls, and green balls separately, and then add them together.\n\nThe total cost of the red balls can be calculated by multiplying the number of red balls (3) by the cost of each red ball ($9):\nTotal cost of red balls = 3 * $9 = $27\n\nSimilarly, the total cost of the blue balls can be calculated by multiplying the number of blue balls (11) by the cost of each blue ball ($5):\nTotal cost of blue balls = 11 * $5 = $55\n\nAnd the total cost of the green balls can be calculated by multiplying the number of green balls (25) by the cost of each green ball ($3):\nTotal cost of green balls = 25 * $3 = $75\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money the store will make by adding the total cost of the red balls, blue balls, and green balls together:\nTotal money received = Total cost of red balls + Total cost of blue balls + Total cost of green balls\nTotal money received = $27 + $55 + $75\nTotal money received = $157\n\nTherefore, the store will have received $157 after selling all the balls.'

"Let's first calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach. We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, so we can set up the equation:\n\n40 minutes = x miles * y minutes/mile\n\nwhere x is the number of miles Grandma walks on the beach and y is the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the beach.\n\nSince we want to find y, we can rearrange the equation:\n\ny = 40 minutes / x miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, so the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is half the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the beach. Therefore, the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is y/2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk 2 miles on the beach. We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, so the time it takes for her to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2 * y.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3-mile walk. We know that she spends 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 2 * y + y/2.\n\nSubstituting the value of y from the equation above, we get:\n\nTotal time = 2 * (40 minutes / x miles) + (40 minutes / (2 * x) miles)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nTotal time = 80 minutes / x + 20 minutes / x\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nTotal time = 100 minutes / x\n\nSince Grandma walks 3 miles, we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:\n\nTotal time = 100 minutes / 3\n\nTherefore, it takes Grandma 100/3 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."

'According to the hint, there are 3 trees each with 7 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21.\n\nThere are also 2 different trees each with 4 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8.\n\nFinally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.\n\nTo find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we add up the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = <<21+8+3=32>>32.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 32 blue birds in the trees.'
"Let's start by converting 2 dozen marbles into a numerical value. \n\n1 dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.\n\nIf Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. \n\nSo, Bob currently has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.\n\nIf Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles. \n\nTherefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles."
"To find the minimum temperature the second mug of water needs to be, we need to consider the temperature change when Donny pours the water into his water bottle.\n\nLet's assume the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.\n\nWhen Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be the same as the temperature of the water poured in, which is 33 degrees.\n\nNow, Donny pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. Since we don't know the exact temperature of the second mug, we can assume that the temperature of the water poured in is x degrees.\n\nTo find the final temperature of the water in the bottle, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the water before and after pouring should be the same.\n\nThe energy of water can be calculated using the formula: energy = mass * temperature.\n\nBefore pouring, the total energy of the water in the bottle is (4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees).\n\nAfter pouring, the total energy of the water in the bottle is (4 ounces + 1 ounce) * final temperature.\n\nSince the total energy before and after pouring should be the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n(4 * 33) + (1 * x) = (5 * final temperature)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n132 + x = 5 * final temperature\n\nTo find the minimum temperature the second mug of water needs to be, we need to find the minimum value of final temperature that satisfies the condition that Donny can drink the water. According to the hint, Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.\n\nSo, we can set up the inequality:\n\nfinal temperature ≥ 40\n\nSubstituting the equation we derived earlier, we get:\n\n132 + x ≥ 5 * 40\n\n132 + x ≥ 200\n\nx ≥ 200 - 132\n\nx ≥ 68\n\nTherefore, the minimum temperature the second mug of water needs to be in order for Donny to be able to drink it after pouring 4 ounces from a 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle is 68 degrees."
'In one day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens.

'Pauline spent a total of $120 on all visits to the museum over the course of 8 years, considering the increase in cost after 5 years.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to the hint, Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. Therefore, Pauline spent $2 * 3 = $6 on each visit.\n\nAfter 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the cost became $2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5.\n\nPauline visited the museum three times a year for 5 years, so she spent $5 * 3 * 5 = $75 during this period.\n\nPauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. During these 3 years, the cost of one visit remained $5. Therefore, she spent $5 * 3 * 3 = $45 during this period.\n\nTo calculate the total amount spent by Pauline on all visits to the museum over the course of 8 years, we add the amounts spent during the first 5 years and the amounts spent during the next 3 years: $75 + $45 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Pauline spent a total of $120 on all visits to the museum over the course of 8 years, considering the increase in cost after 5 years.'
"To find out how long it will take for all students in grades 4-7 to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room and then divide it by the number of students who can try the escape room at a time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade with the most points, and there are 4 grades (4-7), the total number of students who will try the escape room is 10 students x 4 grades = 40 students.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the total number of students. We divide the total number of students (40) by the number of students in each group (8) to get 40 students / 8 students = 5 groups.\n\nSince each group has 45 minutes to try and escape, and there are 5 groups, the total time it will take for all students to try the escape room is 45 minutes x 5 groups = 225 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take 225 minutes for all students in grades 4-7 at Cedar Falls Middle School to try the escape room if each group uses the full 45 minutes."

"To find the percentage of an 8-hour workday spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning classrooms and then divide it by the total time in an 8-hour workday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time spent cleaning classrooms. The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. So, the total time spent cleaning classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.\n\nNext, let's convert the total time spent cleaning classrooms to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1200 minutes is equal to 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of an 8-hour workday spent cleaning classrooms. The custodian works an 8-hour day, which is equal to 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\nTo find the percentage, we divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms (20 hours) by the total time in an 8-hour workday (480 minutes) and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage = (20 hours / 480 minutes) * 100 = (20/480) * 100 = 4.17%\n\nTherefore, on average, the custodian spends approximately 4.17% of their 8-hour workday cleaning classrooms."
"Let's start by finding the number of books that can be held on the bottom shelf. We know that the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which can hold 10 books. So the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of books that can be held on the top shelf. We know that the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which can hold 20 books. So the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held on one bookcase. We have two middle shelves, each holding 10 books, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books in total.\nThe bottom shelf can hold 20 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. So the total number of books that can be held on one bookcase is 20 + 20 + 15 = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.\n\nSince Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books that can be held on one bookcase: 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.\n\nTherefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 books."

'Matthew has 12 toy soldiers in total. Half of his collection is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 toy soldiers.\nThe buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection, so Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for these toys.\nThe other half of the collection is also 6 toy soldiers.\nThe buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy for this half, so Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $<<6*7=42>>42 for these toys.\nIn total, Matthew would earn $30 + $42 = $<<30+42=72>>72 for selling his toy soldiers. Answer: \\boxed{72}.'
"During Nate's vacation, his dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 holes/day * 14 days = <<6*14=84>>84 holes.\n\nWhen Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day. However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. This means that the number of holes Nate needs to fill in each day is 9 holes/day + 6 holes/day = <<9+6=15>>15 holes/day.\n\nTo determine how many weeks it will take for Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes dug by the number of holes Nate fills in each day.\n\nTotal number of holes dug = 84 holes\nNumber of holes Nate fills in each day = 15 holes/day\n\nNumber of days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes = 84 holes / 15 holes/day = 5.6 days\n\nSince we are asked for the number of weeks, we divide the number of days by 7:\n\nNumber of weeks it will take Nate to fill in all the holes = 5.6 days / 7 days/week = 0.8 weeks\n\nTherefore, it will take Nate approximately 0.8 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by his dog."
'To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.\n\nEnrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000 = 3000\n\nThe average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, and the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students.\n\nTo find the difference in enrollment, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.\n\nDifference in enrollment = 4000 - 3000 = 1000\n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.'
'To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.\n\nTotal number of cookies = 7995\nNumber of rainbow cookies = 2595\nNumber of oatmeal cookies = 3075\n\nNumber of chocolate chip cookies = Total number of cookies - Number of rainbow cookies - Number of oatmeal cookies\nNumber of chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075\nNumber of chocolate chip cookies = 2325\n\nTherefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.'
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:\n\nDr. Grumpus requested:\n- 16 test tubes\n- 7 beakers\n- 14 Petri dishes\n\nIgor gathered:\n- Half as many test tubes as requested (8 test tubes)\n- Two more Petri dishes than requested (16 Petri dishes)\n- The correct number of beakers (7 beakers)\n\nThe total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.\n\nTo find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to subtract the number of items he gathered correctly from the total number of items on the lab bench.\n\nTotal number of items on the lab bench = 29\nNumber of items Igor gathered correctly = Number of test tubes + Number of beakers + Number of Petri dishes\n                                      = 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes\n                                      = 31 items\n\nNumber of beakers Igor lost = Total number of items on the lab bench - Number of items Igor gathered correctly\n                           = 29 - 31\n                           = -2\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of beakers, it means that Igor did not lose any beakers."

"Let's break down the information given in the hint:\n\n- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430.\nThis means that Kim raises $320 + $430 = $<<320+430=750>>750.\n\n- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300.\nThis means that Maryam raises $400 + $300 = $<<400+300=700>>700.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money raised by all the girls:\nAlexandra raises $430.\nSarah raises $300.\nKim raises $750.\nMaryam raises $700.\n\nTotal = $430 + $300 + $750 + $700 = $<<430+300+750+700=2180>>2180.\n\nTherefore, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival."
"Let's first find out how long it took Aaron to run one mile. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it means he ran one mile in 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.\n\nNow, let's find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, it means she ran 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 miles.\nSince Aaron runs one mile in 8 minutes, it means Vanessa took 8*8 = <<8*8=64>>64 minutes to run 8 miles.\n\nTherefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the relay race."
"The current length of the dock is 200 feet. According to the caretaker's requirement, he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. So, to find out how many feet of line he needs to buy in total, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3.\n\nTotal feet of line needed = 200 feet (length of dock) * 3 feet (line per foot of dock)\nTotal feet of line needed = 600 feet\n\nHowever, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, we need to subtract this from the total feet of line needed to find out the additional feet of line the caretaker needs to buy.\n\nAdditional feet of line needed = Total feet of line needed - Existing feet of line\nAdditional feet of line needed = 600 feet - 6 feet\nAdditional feet of line needed = 594 feet\n\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line in order to have enough for the current length of the dock."
"Tom's restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, and they are open for 2 days a week. So, in a week, they receive a total of 6 reservations/night * 2 nights/week = <<6*2=12>>12 reservations.\n\nFor each reservation, they order 2 meals costing $5 each, so the cost of the meals per reservation is 2 meals * $5/meal = $<<2*5=10>>10.\n\nThey also order a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation.\n\nSo, the total cost per reservation is $10 for the meals + $5 for the wine = $<<10+5=15>>15.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they make in a week is 12 reservations * $15/reservation = $<<12*15=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}."
'The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80/50 = $1.60.\n\nThe vendor made a profit of 25% on each watermelon, which means the selling price is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price.\n\nTo find the selling price, we can calculate 125% of $1.60:\n125% of $1.60 = (125/100) * $1.60 = $2.\n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.'
"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine the current age of John's youngest son and then add 3 years to it.\n\nWe know that John had a son James when he was 19. Let's assume that James is currently J years old.\n\nWe also know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. So, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n\nSince James is twice as old as Dora, we can write the equation: J = 2D.\n\nSubstituting the value of Dora's age, we get J = 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nNow, we know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Let's assume that the youngest son is currently Y years old.\n\nSince the youngest son was born when John was 32, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years.\n\nSo, the current age of John's youngest son is Y = 13.\n\nAdding 3 years to the current age of John's youngest son, we get Y + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16.\n\nTherefore, John's youngest son will be 16 years old in 3 years."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then calculate the difference.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour. Since Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges in one hour.\n\nNext, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange, she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges in one hour.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the difference. Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after one hour.\n\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after one hour."
'The cost of a new radiator is $400. Mark gets a discount of 80%, so he pays 20% of the original price.\n\n20% of $400 is (20/100) * $400 = $80.\n\nSo Mark pays $80 for the radiator.\n\nThe mechanic takes 3 hours to install the radiator and charges $50 per hour, so the total cost of installation is 3 * $50 = $150.\n\nTherefore, Mark pays $80 for the radiator and $150 for installation, so he pays a total of $80 + $150 = $230. Answer: \\boxed{230}.'
"Let's assume that Farmer Brown has x chickens and y cows on his farm.\n\nSince each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, the total number of legs can be expressed as:\n\n2x + 4y = 70\n\nWe also know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write another equation:\n\nx + y = 20\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n2x + 4y = 70\nx + y = 20\n\nTo solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nMultiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n2(x + y) = 2(20)\n2x + 2y = 40\n\nNow we can subtract this equation from the first equation:\n\n(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40\n2y = 30\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\ny = 15\n\nNow substitute this value of y back into the second equation to find x:\n\nx + 15 = 20\nx = 20 - 15\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens on his farm."
'There are a total of 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, there are a total of 7 * 8 = <<7*8=56>>56 slices of pizza.\n\nHenry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally, so they will divide the 56 slices among themselves.\n\nTo find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.\n\nThere are 1 + 3 = <<1+3=4>>4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends).\n\nTherefore, each person can have 56 / 4 = <<56/4=14>>14 slices of pizza.'
