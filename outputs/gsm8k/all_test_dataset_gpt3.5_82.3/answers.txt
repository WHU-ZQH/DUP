The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000

The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep

First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160
When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home
#### 45
Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

#### 694
He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13
#### 13
First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18
#### 18
There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.
#### 60
If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train
#### 230
First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week
After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs

First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
#### 10
If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.

Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.

Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.
#### 51
First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year
#### 18000
There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
#### 25
If Jenna got half as many apples as her mom, then she got 1/2 * 20 apples = <<20*1/2=10>>10 apples

In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.
He did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.
After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles
Then find the length of the two short sides of the park: 1.5 miles * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 miles
Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times
#### 84
When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.
#### 192
Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.
#### 45
First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds
#### 5600
First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00

#### 6
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits
#### 168
Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.
#### 11
A third of the pennies in a cup is 9,300/3 = <<9300/3=3100>>3,100.

The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
#### 9500
Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.
He paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.
#### 118000
It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

#### 40
Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.
Half the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450

Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96
Then multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72

Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month
If he earns $50 every day he then earns $50/day * 24 days/month = $<<50*24=1200>>1200/month
A year is equal to 12 months so every year he earns $1200/month * 12 months/year = $<<1200*12=14400>>14400
#### 14400
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00
#### 50
Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.
#### 200
Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.
#### 350
Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.
So, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person
#### 7
His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.
Margareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.
So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.
#### 80
First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees
#### 49
Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6
#### 6
As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

#### 40
The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

#### 12
Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35
#### 35
Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

He added another $10 so he had $11+$10=$<<11+10=21>>21.
Then he had $21-$8=$<<21-8=13>>13 after spending $8.
So, he now has $13*3=$<<13*3=39>>39.
#### 39
Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50
#### 50
Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.
Four peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.
Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50
Two pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50.
The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.
Thus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.
Therefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.

Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
#### 17
Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500
#### 17500

Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

#### 43,500
The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year
#### 262500
The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500

One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

The total bill is $100 because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100
He leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25
#### 25
The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.
#### 68
Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts 50% into her retirement so that’s 2400*.50 = $<<2400*.50=1200.00>>1200.00
Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts $1200 into retirement so that leaves 2400-1200 = $<<2400-1200=1200.00>>1200.00
Her car payment is 20% of 2400 so her car payment is .20*2400 = $<<20*.01*2400=480.00>>480.00
She had $1200 left and she uses $480.00 to make her car payment which leaves her with 1200-480 = $<<1200-480=720.00>>720.00 remaining for spending

First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks
#### 135
Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.
#### 200
Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.

Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points

#### 16
Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.
#### 5
The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.

#### 15
There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.
#### 25
A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.
If the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.
If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.

Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.
#### 480
Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box
Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 equal boxes so there are 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 bars in each box
Peter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box

Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day
#### 43200
So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich

Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years

Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.
#### 251
Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.

The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class
So he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week
That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%
#### 25
Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.
#### 270
First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles
#### 10
He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over
He uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills
He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills

The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.

Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.
Two bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.
So, Lani spent $30 +$200 =$<<30+200=230>>230.
Therefore, they spent $105 + $230 = $<<105+230=335>>335 in all.
#### 335
The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60

Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks
