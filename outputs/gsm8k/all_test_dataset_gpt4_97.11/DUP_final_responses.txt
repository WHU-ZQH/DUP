'First, we need to find out how much the value of the house increased by. To do this, we multiply the original price of the house by 150% (or 1.5), so $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.\n\nThis means the value of the house increased by $120,000, so the house is now worth $80,000 (original price) + $120,000 (increase) = $200,000.\n\nHowever, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, his total investment in the house is $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\n\nTo find out how much profit he made, we subtract his total investment from the final value of the house. So, $200,000 (final value) - $130,000 (total investment) = $70,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 from flipping the house.'

"Step 1: Calculate the distance John initially drove away from home.\nJohn drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. Distance = Speed x Time, so Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance John drove back towards home.\n- He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance in this time.\n- He then drove for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph. Distance = Speed x Time, so Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n- He then drove for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph. Distance = Speed x Time, so Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\nStep 3: Add up the distances John drove back towards home.\nDistance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the distance John drove back towards home from the distance he initially drove away from home.\nDistance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\nSo, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours."

"First, let's calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the relay.\n\nFor the well-rounded team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. So, the total time for this team is 55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds.\n\nFor the less well-rounded team, the first runner completes their leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for this team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the well-rounded team wins by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds."

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups would be $36000 - $1200 = $34800.\n\n3. Now, we need to find out the cost of each cup. Since twenty dozen cups is 240 cups (because 1 dozen is 12, so 20 dozen is 20*12=240), the cost of each cup would be $34800 / 240 = $145. \n\nSo, each cup costs $145.'
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Sara has earned from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she has earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.\n\nSara also had $10 saved before she started babysitting, so the total amount of money she has is $10 + $20 = $30.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes. She needs $70 and she has $30, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times. \n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."

'1. First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops that Manolo bought. Since each lollipop costs $0.40 and he bought 5, the total cost for the lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.\n\n2. Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total amount Manolo spent to find out how much he spent on candies. So, $3.20 (total amount) - $2.00 (cost of lollipops) = $1.20.\n\n3. Since Manolo bought 4 candies for $1.20, each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\n\n4. Now, calculate how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. And since each candy costs $0.30, 10 candies will cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.\n\n5. Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost. So, $4.00 (cost of 10 lollipops) + $3.00 (cost of 10 candies) = $7.00.\n\nSo, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.'

"From the hints, we know that:\n\n1. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.\n2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.\n\nThis means that Bahati's score is equal to Azibo's score + 20 and also equal to Dinar's score + 10. \n\nSince Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points, we can set up the following equation:\n\nAzibo's score + 20 (Bahati's score) + Azibo's score + Dinar's score = 45\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2 * Azibo's score + Dinar's score + 20 = 45\n\nFrom hint 4, we know that Bahati's score is 10 more than Dinar's score, so Dinar's score is Bahati's score - 10. We can substitute this into the equation:\n\n2 * Azibo's score + (Bahati's score - 10) + 20 = 45\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2 * Azibo's score + Bahati's score + 10 = 45\n\nSince Bahati's score is Azibo's score + 20, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n2 * Azibo's score + (Azibo's score + 20) + 10 = 45\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3 * Azibo's score + 30 = 45\n\nSubtracting 30 from both sides gives:\n\n3 * Azibo's score = 15\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\nAzibo's score = 5\n\nSo, Azibo scored 5 points."

'1. The total number of beds in the hospital is 1000.\n2. Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds.\n3. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds at the start is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.\n4. Each day, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.\n5. So, after 2 weeks, the number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 700 = 100 beds. \n\nSo, there are 100 unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.'

"From the hints, we know that:\n\n1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.\n2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya.\n3. Aliya is 3 years old.\n\nFirst, we can find out how old Shawna is. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 years old.\n\nThen, we can find out how old Shawna's father is. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, and Shawna is 9 years old, Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = <<5*9=45>>45 years old.\n\nSo, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"1. Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number.\n2. Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%.\n\nTo find out the real number of people who attended the concert, we need to subtract the overstated percentage from Courtney's reported number.\n\nFirst, find out how much is 20% of 48:\n20/100 * 48 = 9.6\n\nThen, subtract this number from Courtney's reported number:\n48 - 9.6 = 38.4\n\nSince the number of people cannot be a decimal, we round it off to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the real number of people who attended the concert is approximately 38."

'1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.\n2. They dug 13 more holes on the second day, bringing the total to 10 + 13 = 23 holes.\n3. On the third day, they dug 8 more holes, bringing the total to 23 + 8 = 31 holes.\n4. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day was 31 - 2 = 29 holes.\n5. By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.\n6. Therefore, the pirates must have dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Answer: \\boxed{11}.'

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and Ad respectively.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\nA + S + Ad = 339 (since together they have caught 339 Pokemon)\n\nA = S + 5 (since Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)\n\nS = 4Ad - 13 (since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught)\n\nWe can substitute the second and third equations into the first one:\n\n(S + 5) + S + (4Ad - 13) = 339\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2S + 4Ad - 8 = 339\n\nSimplify further to:\n\n2S + 4Ad = 347\n\nDivide the entire equation by 2:\n\nS + 2Ad = 173.5\n\nBut since the number of Pokemon caught cannot be a fraction, there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check.\n\nThe mistake is in the substitution of the third equation into the first one. It should be:\n\n(S + 5) + S + ((S + 13) / 4) = 339\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2S + 5 + S/4 + 13/4 = 339\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n8S + 20 + S + 13 = 1356\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n9S + 33 = 1356\n\nSubtract 33 from both sides:\n\n9S = 1323\n\nDivide by 9:\n\nS = 147\n\nSo, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."

"1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance covered is 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles.\n2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance covered is 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles. However, since this is in the opposite direction, it reduces the total distance covered.\n3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance covered is 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles.\n4. To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the distances covered flying south and subtract the distance covered flying north. This gives us 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.\n\nSo, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."

"1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.\n2. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.\n3. He had to return home halfway to the store.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the distance James walked before he had to return home. Since he was halfway to the store, he walked 4 miles / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time it took James to walk this distance. Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time it took James to return home. Since he was halfway to the store, he had to walk another 2 miles back home, which took him another 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the time it took James to walk from his home to the store after he returned home. Since his home is 4 miles from the store, it took him 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.\n\nStep 5: Add up the time it took James to walk to the store, return home, and walk to the store again. This is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nSo, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
'First, calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total by multiplying the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas\n\nThen calculate how much it would have cost to buy all these bananas individually by multiplying the number of bananas by the cost per banana: 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00\n\nThen calculate how much Jenny actually paid for the bananas by multiplying the number of bunches by the cost per bunch: 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00\n\nFinally, subtract the actual cost from the cost of buying the bananas individually to find the savings: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00. \n\nSo, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.'

"1. The price of one MTB is $500.\n2. BMX is half the price of an MTB, so one BMX is $500/2 = $250.\n3. A Trekking bike is $450.\n4. Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in one month.\n5. Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n6. 15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 300*15/100 = 45 BMX bikes.\n7. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike:\n\n- From selling Trekking bikes, he earned 150 * $450 = $67,500.\n- From selling BMX bikes, he earned 45 * $250 = $11,250.\n- From selling MTB bikes, he earned 105 * $500 = $52,500.\n\nSo, in total, Marcel earned $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
'Step 1: Calculate how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours.\nThe farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales of hay.\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours.\nThe truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales of hay.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of bales the truck picks up from the number of bales the farmer makes to find out how many bales are left in the field.\nThe number of bales left in the field is 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales of hay.\n\nSo, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field after a 6 hour day.'
"First, let's calculate how many minutes John spends in class each day. He has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, which is 8 classes in total. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class each day.\n\nSince he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each day. So he spends 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes each day on the weekend.\n\nSo in total, he spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes on the weekend.\n\nAdding this to his weekday class time, he spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he spends 1800 / 60 = 30 hours learning each week."

'1. The total number of toys needed is 400.\n2. There are 5 workers in total.\n3. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in a 10-hour shift, they produce 2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys each, for a total of 240 toys.\n4. Two other workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in a 10-hour shift, they produce 2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys each, for a total of 160 toys.\n5. So, the first four workers produce a total of 240 toys + 160 toys = 400 toys.\n6. However, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys, which means the total number of toys produced by all five workers is 400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys.\n7. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced 380 toys - 400 toys = -20 toys. This is not possible, so there must be a mistake in the problem. The fifth worker cannot produce a negative number of toys. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is subtracted from the total order of 400 toys, then:\n\n1. The total number of toys produced by the first four workers is 240 toys + 160 toys = 400 toys.\n2. The total order is 400 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced 400 toys - 400 toys = 0 toys.\n3.

"1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs they each painted as A and M respectively. So, A = M.\n\n2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs they each painted as C and S respectively. So, C + S = 30.\n\n3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, C = S + 12.\n\n4. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. So, A + M + C + S = 56.\n\nFrom the above information, we can start solving the problem:\n\nFirst, we can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us S + 12 + S = 30. Solving this equation gives us S = 9 and C = 21.\n\nNext, we substitute C = 21 and S = 9 into the equation A + M + C + S = 56, which gives us A + M + 21 + 9 = 56. Solving this equation gives us A + M = 26.\n\nSince A = M, we can divide 26 by 2 to find the number of eggs each of them painted. So, A = M = 13.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted. So, C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.\n\nSo, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."

"1. The total amount of water Donny has is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug).\n2. The total temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.\n3. The total temperature of the water is the sum of the temperature of the water from each mug, weighted by the amount of water from each mug.\n4. The total temperature of the water from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees * 4 ounces = 132 degree-ounces.\n5. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as T. The total temperature of the water from the second mug is T degrees * 1 ounce = T degree-ounces.\n6. The total temperature of the water is 132 degree-ounces + T degree-ounces = (132 + T) degree-ounces.\n7. The total temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees * 5 ounces = 200 degree-ounces.\n8. Therefore, we have the inequality (132 + T) degree-ounces >= 200 degree-ounces.\n9.

A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20*50 = 1000 fruits.\n5. An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.\n6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it's 0 fruits.\n\nSo, the total amount of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n1. R = 4B (the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)\n2. B = Y - 7 (the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)\n3. R + B + Y = 37 (the combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters)\n\nWe can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:\n\n4B + B + (B + 7) = 37\n6B + 7 = 37\n6B = 30\nB = 5\n\nSubstitute B = 5 into R = 4B:\n\nR = 4 * 5 = 20\n\nSo, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
'1. Ronnie was given $5.\n2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n3. After giving money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money. 1/5 of $15 is $15/5 = $<<15/5=3>>3.\n4. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their sister, Ronnie also gave away $3.\n5. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2. \n\nTherefore, Ronnie has $2 left.'
'1. The mural used 12 pints of paint in all.\n2. Half the mural is yellow, so 12/2 = 6 pints of yellow paint was used.\n3. The other half of the mural is red, white, and purple paint, so 12 - 6 = 6 pints of paint was used for these three colors.\n4. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, each color used 6/3 = 2 pints of paint.\nSo, 2 pints of red paint was used in the mural.'

'- Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000/20 = <<1000/20=50>>50 bills.\n- He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 bills left.\n- He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he has 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bills left.\n- Thomas then triples his money, so he has 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 bills.\n- He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each of his bills is worth $20, he gets 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 five dollar bills for each of his bills. So he has 60 * 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 five dollar bills. Answer: \\boxed{240}.'
'1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.\n2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, which means team B scores 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.\n3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.\n4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which means team A scores 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 goals.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 (team A in the first half) + 2 (team B in the first half) + 8 (team B in the second half) + 2 (team A in the second half) = 16 goals.'
'1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.\n2. On Monday, he used up 45% of the chalk. This means he used 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches of chalk.\n3. This leaves him with 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk after Monday.\n4. After Monday, the teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day. This means he will use 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches of chalk each day.\n5. The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. This means he can use the chalk until it is 2 inches long.\n6. So, the teacher has 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches of chalk to use before he needs to recycle it.\n7. This means he can use the chalk for 0.75 / 0.55 = approximately 1.36 days.\n8. Since the teacher cannot use the chalk for a fraction of a day, he will have to recycle the chalk after 1 more day. \n\nSo, the teacher has 1 more day before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.'

"First, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. He drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth, but since the capped teeth include the drilled ones, we don't count them twice. So, the dentist fixes 11 teeth in total.\n\nFinally, we need to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the number of teeth the dentist fixes by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo, the dentist fixes (11 / 30) * 100 = 36.67% of James' teeth. \n\nSo, the dentist fixes approximately 37% of James' teeth when rounded to the nearest whole number."

"Let's break down the information:\n\n- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. This means they added 50 bandages to their stock.\n- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 28 bandages.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (which is 100 bandages) and only used half a pack (which is 25 bandages).\n- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\n- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and added 50, so they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.\n- On the second day, they used 28 bandages. So, they must have started the day with 12 (leftover from the first day) + 28 (used on the second day) = 40 bandages.\n- On the third day, they added 100 bandages and used 25. So, they must have started the day with 40 (leftover from the second day) + 25 (used on the third day) = 65 bandages.\n- But they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means they must have had 78 + 25 (used on the third day) = 103 bandages at the start of the third day.\n\nSo, there is a discrepancy here. The calculations suggest they should have had 65 bandages at the start of the third day, but they actually had 103. This suggests that they must have started with more bandages on the first day than we initially thought.\n\nSo, if we add the discrepancy to the number of bandages they started with on the first day (which we initially thought was 38), we get 38 + (103 - 65) = 38 + 38 = 76 bandages.\n\nSo, the nurses must have started with 76 bandages on the first day."

"The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. So, in 3 days, it removes 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 liters of water.\n\nThe medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day. In 3 days, it removes 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 liters of water.\n\nThe high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 liters of water per day. In 5 days, it removes 5*4 = <<5*4=20>>20 liters of water.\n\nSo, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 3+6+20 = <<3+6+20=29>>29 liters.

"First, we need to find out how many diapers are used in total per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, we multiply 5 by 2 to get 10 diapers per day.\n\nNext, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Since there are 10 diapers changed per day, half of that would be 10 divided by 2, which equals 5 diapers.\n\nTherefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The volume of a rectangular prism (which this jar is, given it has a square base and is tall) is length x width x height. So, the volume of the jar is 6 inches x 6 inches x 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to account for the packing efficiency. If the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, that means 80% of the jar's volume is taken up by jelly beans. So, the volume taken up by the jelly beans is 80% of 540 cubic inches = 0.8 x 540 = 432 cubic inches.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many jelly beans this volume represents. If each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, then the number of jelly beans is the total jelly bean volume divided by the volume of each jelly bean. So, the total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches Ã· 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.\n\nTim estimates that 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, his guess for the number of red jelly beans is 30% of 2880 = 0.3 x 2880 = 864 red jelly beans.\n\nThe true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, Tim's guess was off by 900 - 864 = 36 red jelly beans."

'1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered 16/2 = 8 test tubes.\n2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, and Igor gathered two more beakers than this. So, Igor initially gathered 14 + 2 = 16 beakers.\n3. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. This includes the 8 test tubes and the unknown number of Petri dishes and beakers.\n4. If we subtract the number of test tubes from the total number of items, we get 29 - 8 = 21. This is the combined number of Petri dishes and beakers that Igor placed on the lab bench.\n5. We know that Igor gathered 14 Petri dishes, as this was the number requested by Dr. Grumpus.\n6. So, the number of beakers that Igor placed on the lab bench must be 21 (the combined number of Petri dishes and beakers) - 14 (the number of Petri dishes) = 7 beakers.\n7. But Igor initially gathered 16 beakers. So, the number of beakers that Igor lost must be 16 (the initial number of beakers) - 7 (the number of beakers placed on the lab bench) = 9 beakers.\n\nSo, Igor lost 9 beakers.'
