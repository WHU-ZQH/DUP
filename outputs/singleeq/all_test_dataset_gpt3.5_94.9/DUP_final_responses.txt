'To find the cost of one pencil, we need to subtract the cost of the notebook and ruler from the total amount spent.\n\nTotal amount spent = 74 cents\nCost of notebook = 35 cents\nCost of ruler = 18 cents\n\nTotal cost of notebook and ruler = 35 cents + 18 cents = 53 cents\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost of the notebook and ruler from the total amount spent to find the cost of the pencils.\n\nCost of pencils = Total amount spent - Total cost of notebook and ruler\nCost of pencils = 74 cents - 53 cents\nCost of pencils = 21 cents\n\nSince Mrs. Hilt bought 3 pencils, we divide the cost of the pencils by the number of pencils to find the cost of one pencil.\n\nCost of one pencil = Cost of pencils / Number of pencils\nCost of one pencil = 21 cents / 3 pencils\nCost of one pencil = 7 cents\n\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is 7 cents.'
'To find out how many markers are in each package, we need to divide the total number of markers (40) by the number of packages (7).\n\n40 markers ÷ 7 packages = 5.71 markers per package\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a marker, we round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 markers in each package when Mrs. Hilt divides her 40 markers equally into 7 packages.'
'To find the total number of chapters Mrs. Hilt read, we need to multiply the number of chapters in each book by the number of books she read.\n\nNumber of chapters in each book = 17\nNumber of books = 4\n\nTotal number of chapters = Number of chapters in each book * Number of books\nTotal number of chapters = 17 * 4\nTotal number of chapters = 68\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Hilt read a total of 68 chapters.'

"Let's assume Milan was billed for x minutes last month.\n\nThe cost for the monthly fee is $2.\nThe cost for the minutes is 12 cents per minute, so the total cost for the minutes is 0.12x dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Milan's long distance bill is $2 + 0.12x.\n\nAccording to the problem, Milan's long distance bill last month was $23.36.\n\nSo we can set up the equation:\n2 + 0.12x = 23.36\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n0.12x = 21.36\n\nDividing both sides by 0.12:\nx = 21.36 / 0.12\n\nx ≈ 178\n\nTherefore, Milan was billed for approximately 178 minutes on his long distance phone service last month."
"Let's assume the value of the sport utility vehicle last year was x dollars.\nAccording to the information given, the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of last year's vehicle.\nSo, we can write the equation:\n0.8 * x = 16,000\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\nx = 16,000 / 0.8\nx = 20,000\nTherefore, the value of the sport utility vehicle last year was $20,000."
"Let's assume Trenton's sales for the week are x dollars.\nHis commission on sales would be 0.04 * x dollars.\nTherefore, his total earnings for the week would be 190 + 0.04 * x dollars.\nAccording to the question, his goal is to earn at least 500 dollars.\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n190 + 0.04 * x ≥ 500\nSubtracting 190 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n0.04 * x ≥ 310\nDividing both sides of the equation by 0.04, we get:\nx ≥ 310 / 0.04\nx ≥ 7750\nTherefore, Trenton must make at least $7750 in sales to reach his goal of earning at least $500 this week."
"To find out how many years it will take for Tony's 4-foot tree to grow to a height of 29 feet, we need to determine how much the tree will grow each year.\n\nThe tree grows at a rate of 5 feet every year. So, in the first year, the tree will grow by 5 feet, making its height 4 + 5 = 9 feet.\n\nIn the second year, the tree will grow by another 5 feet, making its height 9 + 5 = 14 feet.\n\nIn the third year, the tree will grow by another 5 feet, making its height 14 + 5 = 19 feet.\n\nIn the fourth year, the tree will grow by another 5 feet, making its height 19 + 5 = 24 feet.\n\nIn the fifth year, the tree will grow by another 5 feet, making its height 24 + 5 = 29 feet.\n\nTherefore, it will take 5 years for Tony's 4-foot tree to grow to a height of 29 feet."

'According to the information given, Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply to be 1,800,000 metric tons. The supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand.\n\nLet\'s assume the world grain demand is represented by D.\n\nAccording to the given information, the supply is only 0.75 of the demand. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nSupply = 0.75 * Demand\n\nWe are given that the supply is 1,800,000 metric tons. So we can write the equation as:\n\n1,800,000 = 0.75 * Demand\n\nTo find the demand, we need to isolate the variable "Demand" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\n1,800,000 / 0.75 = Demand\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n2,400,000 = Demand\n\nTherefore, according to Freeport McMoran\'s estimate, the projected world grain demand is 2,400,000 metric tons.'
'To find the cost per ounce of a 12 ounce can of cranberry juice, we need to divide the total cost of the can by the number of ounces.\n\nThe total cost of the can is 84 cents, and the size of the can is 12 ounces.\n\nSo, the cost per ounce can be calculated as:\n\nCost per ounce = Total cost / Number of ounces\n\nCost per ounce = 84 cents / 12 ounces\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nCost per ounce = 7 cents\n\nTherefore, the cost per ounce of a 12 ounce can of cranberry juice is 7 cents.'
'To determine how much money Manuel must save each week, we need to subtract his initial deposit from his savings goal and divide it by the number of weeks.\n\nSavings goal: $500\nInitial deposit: $177\nNumber of weeks: 19\n\nAmount Manuel needs to save each week = (Savings goal - Initial deposit) / Number of weeks\n= ($500 - $177) / 19\n= $323 / 19\n≈ $17.00\n\nTherefore, Manuel must save approximately $17.00 each week in order to reach his savings goal of $500 in 19 weeks, starting with an initial deposit of $177.'
"Let's assume the number of hours the mechanic worked is x.\n\nThe cost for the parts is $225.\n\nThe cost for the labor is $45 per hour, so the total cost for the labor is 45x.\n\nThe total bill is $450, so we can write the equation:\n\n225 + 45x = 450\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n45x = 450 - 225\n\n45x = 225\n\nx = 225 / 45\n\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the mechanic worked for 5 hours."
