'According to the information given, Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply to be 1,800,000 metric tons. The supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand.\n\nLet\'s assume the world grain demand is represented by D.\n\nAccording to the given information, the supply is only 0.75 of the demand. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nSupply = 0.75 * Demand\n\nWe are given that the supply is 1,800,000 metric tons. So we can write the equation as:\n\n1,800,000 = 0.75 * Demand\n\nTo find the demand, we need to isolate the variable "Demand" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\n1,800,000 / 0.75 = Demand\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n2,400,000 = Demand\n\nTherefore, according to Freeport McMoran\'s estimate, the projected world grain demand is 2,400,000 metric tons.'
