If 532 people are currently occupying some of those seats, we can find the number of empty seats by subtracting the number of people from the total number of seats. \n\nSo, 750 (total seats) - 532 (occupied seats) = 218\n\nTherefore, there are 218 empty seats in the theater.'
'To find the total pounds of oranges in 45 bags, you need to multiply the number of bags by the pounds of oranges in each bag. \n\nSo, 45 bags * 23 pounds/bag = 1035 pounds of oranges.\n\nTherefore, there are 1035 pounds of oranges in 45 bags.'
'Bert runs 2 miles every day. \n\nThere are 7 days in a week. \n\nSo, in one week, Bert runs 2 miles/day * 7 days/week = 14 miles/week.\n\nTherefore, in 3 weeks, Bert will run 14 miles/week * 3 weeks = 42 miles. \n\nSo, Bert will run 42 miles in 3 weeks.'
'First, we need to subtract the monthly fee from the total bill to find out how much Milan paid for the actual minutes. \n\n23.36 (total bill) - 2 (monthly fee) = 21.36 dollars\n\nNext, we need to convert the cost per minute from cents to dollars since the total cost for the minutes is given in dollars. \n\n12 cents = 0.12 dollars\n\nNow, we can find out the number of minutes by dividing the total cost for the minutes by the cost per minute. \n\n21.36 (total cost for minutes) รท 0.12 (cost per minute) = 178 minutes\n\nSo, Milan was billed for 178 minutes.'
'The value of the sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars, which is 0.8 (or 80%) of its value last year. \n\nTo find the value of the vehicle last year, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.8 * (Value last year) = 16,000 dollars\n\nTo solve for the value last year, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\n(Value last year) = 16,000 dollars / 0.8 = 20,000 dollars\n\nSo, the value of the sport utility vehicle last year was 20,000 dollars.'
'First, we need to determine how much more money Trenton needs to earn to reach his goal of 500 dollars. We do this by subtracting his weekly wage from his goal:\n\n500 - 190 = 310 dollars\n\nThis means Trenton needs to earn 310 dollars from his commission. \n\nSince his commission is equal to 0.04 of his sales, we can set up the equation 0.04x = 310, where x is the amount of sales Trenton needs to make. \n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.04:\n\nx = 310 / 0.04 = 7750 dollars\n\nTherefore, Trenton needs to make 7750 dollars in sales to reach his goal of earning no less than 500 dollars this week.'
'The tree is initially 4 feet tall and needs to reach a height of 29 feet. Therefore, the tree needs to grow an additional 29 - 4 = 25 feet.\n\nSince the tree grows at a rate of 5 feet per year, it will take 25 / 5 = 5 years for the tree to reach a height of 29 feet.'
'The tallest player on the basketball team is 77.75 inches tall. This player is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player. To find the height of the shortest player, we need to subtract the difference in height from the height of the tallest player.\n\nSo, we subtract 9.5 inches from 77.75 inches.\n\n77.75 inches - 9.5 inches = 68.25 inches\n\nTherefore, the shortest player on the basketball team is 68.25 inches tall.'
"Let's denote the number we are looking for as x.\n\nAccording to the problem, 0.20 of this number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. We can write this as an equation:\n\n0.20*x - 4 = 6\n\nTo solve for x, we first add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n0.20*x = 6 + 4\n0.20*x = 10\n\nThen, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20:\n\nx = 10 / 0.20\nx = 50\n\nSo, the number we are looking for is 50."
'If the world grain supply is only 0.75 of the world grain demand, it means that the supply is 75% of the demand. \n\nTo find the world grain demand, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.75 * Demand = Supply\n\nSubstituting the given supply value into the equation, we get:\n\n0.75 * Demand = 1800000 metric tons\n\nTo solve for Demand, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\nDemand = 1800000 metric tons / 0.75 = 2400000 metric tons\n\nTherefore, Freeport McMoran projects the world grain demand to be 2400000 metric tons.'
'To find the cost per ounce, you divide the total cost by the total number of ounces. In this case, the total cost is 84 cents and the total number of ounces is 12. \n\nSo, you would divide 84 by 12 to get the cost per ounce. \n\n84 รท 12 = 7 \n\nTherefore, the cost in cents per ounce of a 12 ounce can of cranberry juice that sells for 84 cents is 7 cents per ounce.'
'First, we need to determine how much more money Manuel needs to save to reach his goal of 500 dollars. He has already deposited 177 dollars, so we subtract this amount from his goal:\n\n500 - 177 = 323 dollars\n\nThis is the amount he needs to save over the next 19 weeks. To find out how much he needs to save each week, we divide this amount by the number of weeks:\n\n323 รท 19 = 17 dollars\n\nTherefore, Manuel needs to save 17 dollars each week to reach his goal of 500 dollars in 19 weeks.'
'The total bill was 450 dollars, and the cost of the parts was 225 dollars. So, the cost of the labor was 450 - 225 = 225 dollars.\n\nThe mechanic charged 45 dollars an hour. So, the number of hours the job took was 225 / 45 = 5 hours.'
